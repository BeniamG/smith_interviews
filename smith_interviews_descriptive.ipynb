       "'Interview: SF657\\nI:\\tSo, before we get started on the interview, I just kind of want to go over some logistics first. I guess the first question is can you hear me okay?\\nR:\\tI can hear you perfectly.\\nI:\\tGreat. So the first thing is, would you be able to give me your address? We’re compensating our interviewees $40--\\nR:\\tSo here’s what I’m going to ask you. I work [inaudible 1:26] program of recovery right now, and I see this as part of my service that I can make amends.\\nI:\\tOkay. \\nR:\\tAnd I’d like you to donate that money, if you could really do this, is to The Safe House. The Safe House is actually a place in San Francisco that gets women off the street who have been in prostitution. If you could instead of giving it to me, if you guys could make a check out to them and give them money I would really appreciate it.\\nI:\\tThat’s really wonderful of you. Yes, I believe we’ve had other respondents ask the same, and I believe that that is possible. So I can talk with the lead researcher, and I will let you know.\\nR:\\tThat’s fine.\\nI:\\tWe do need to send you a consent form. I’m going to walk you through the consent form and ask for your verbal approval, but is there an address--either an email address or mailing address--that we can send a hard copy of the consent form to?\\nR:\\tYes. And nothing I say is going to have my name in it, right?\\nI:\\tThat’s correct. Yes. I’ll go through that in more detail. Yes.\\nR:\\t[gives address]\\nI:\\tGreat. So I’m going to walk you through the consent form right now. Feel free to stop me if you have any clarification questions. I’m just going to read it. Just ask me if you have any questions. \\nR:\\t[Inaudible 3:13].\\nI:\\tYou’re cutting out a little bit.\\nR:\\t[Inaudible 3:25].\\nI:\\tThat’s fine. The other thing, too, is when we get to the interview--I don’t know if you have headphones or something; sometimes when folks have the phone on speaker it can be hard if we go ahead and record--if you give your permission for us to record. \\nR:\\tI’m on a headset. [Inaudible 3:44].\\nI:\\tGreat. So introduction and purpose. My name is Sandra Smith--Sandra Smith is not me, but she is the lead researcher--and I’m a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley in the department of Sociology. I would like to invite you to take part in my research study. I am interested in learning more about your experiences with the criminal justice system so that I can better understand the effects of diversion programs and pretrial detention. What I learn from this study might help to inform local and national conversations about reforms to the criminal justice system. \\nIf you agree to participate in my research, I--or another trained researcher--will conduct an interview with you at the time of your choosing. The interview will involve questions about your experiences with the criminal justice system, and how you have fared personally, socially, and financially over the past few years. \\nMany questions have multiple choice responses, but there will be times when I will ask you to elaborate. The interview should last between an hour and a-half and two hours. With your permission the interview will be audio recorded using a digital recorder. The recoding is to accurately record the information you provide, and will be used for transcription purposes only. \\nIf you choose not to be recorded, notes will be taken instead. If you agree to begin being recorded, but feel uncomfortable at any time, the recorder can be turned off at your request. And if you don’t want to continue, you can stop the interview at any time as well. \\nWe expect to conduct only one interview. However, follow-ups may be needed for added clarification on any points you have made. If so, a member of our team will contact you by mail or phone. \\nAnd then a little bit about benefits. I do not expect you to experience any direct benefit from your participation in this study. My hope is that research findings will represent a contribution to our general knowledge of diversion programs and pretrial detention. If you’re interested, we are happy to share with you documents that are prepared based on the findings from this study. \\nAnd so because the interview includes questions on sensitive topics--such as experiences with the criminal justice system--there is a risk that you might become upset and/or feel uncomfortable. Some respondents may feel sadness or anger while sharing their experiences. You may, however, refuse to answer any of the questions posed during the course of this interview. And you may request that the recording be halted at any point.\\nYour participation is completely voluntary. Furthermore, whether or not you choose to participate in the research--and whether or not you choose to answer a question or continue participating--there will not be any penalty to you or loss of the benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. \\nDigital recordings are sent to a transcriptionist, so an additional risk is associated with a possible breach of confidentiality. In an attempt to ensure your confidentiality will not be breached by the transcriptionist, the transcriptionist will sign a confidentiality agreement. \\nSo the last part is confidentiality. \\nR:\\tThey will not have my address, right?\\nI:\\tThat’s correct. That is correct. That is kept with us only. And that will be destroyed, once we send you the confidentiality agreement.\\nR:\\tGot it. All right.\\nI:\\tSo you will be asked for signed consent, which we will send to you. And all of the information you provide will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used. As with all research, however, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised--however, I am taking precautions to minimize this risk. No actual names will be used in any published materials concerning the study. Your identity will be kept on a master list that is maintained by the researcher, and the transcript will be coded to protect privacy.\\nR:\\tThere is one thing. Do you have every word verbatim, or can you just [inaudible 7:37]? I feel uncomfortable with people reading word-for-word verbatim.\\nI:\\tYeah, that’s fair. \\nR:\\tIf we’re going to do this, I just feel more comfortable … now, in the survey, I understand. You have to do that. But right now I’m just getting frustrated with this going word-for-word verbatim. I agree to what you’re saying. I believe in it. I am going to ask of you as well, is after we’re done--because I want to get my records sealed. I am going to ask you guys to send me a letter, saying, “[Name] participated in this. It was helpful.” Or something to that effect.\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tThat’s what I’m asking.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. I think that won’t be a problem.\\n[Interruption] \\nR:\\tSorry about that; I just had a family thing I had to deal with.\\nI:\\tNo worries. Are you good to go?\\nR:\\tYes. Anyway, you can send [inaudible 11:07] after I’ve participated. Is that right?\\nI:\\tYes. I believe so. I don’t want to make any promises. I need to double-check that with the research director. But I have noted that and I will follow up with her.\\nR:\\tOkay, got it. So let’s go through the … I want to make this as quick as possible. I know it’s going to take an hour and a-half, but let’s cut through a lot of stuff. I’m okay with … I understand you’re going to try to protect my confidentiality as much as possible. There’s going to be a non-disclose by the person who is doing the transcript. Got it. Okay.\\nI:\\tWe’ll destroy the digital recordings of the interviews after the research. The only other thing I would say is that the transcripts or notes may be saved for future research, but they’ll be destroyed within … they’ll be kept for up to ten years and then destroyed.\\nR:\\tWhat is going to be kept? But it’s not going to have my name in, right?\\nI:\\tNo, no. \\nR:\\tOkay.\\nI:\\tThe transcripts will have not your name. We’re coding them with non-identifiable things.\\nR:\\tAll right. That’s fine.\\nI:\\tGreat. So can you just give me verbal consent.\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tCool. And then verbal consent you’re okay with us recording. Is that correct?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. Thank you so much. So because I am over the phone it’s harder to kind of … sometimes it can be harder, being conducted over the phone. So if you are kind of feeling like you need a break or anything, or a question anytime--just kind of flag it and let me know.\\nR:\\tOkay.\\nI:\\tLet’s begin with your current circumstances. I’m going to start with a few questions about your background, your relationships, and your experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. So starting with your background, the first questions is how old are you?\\nR:\\tYou’re cutting out, by the way.\\nI:\\tIs this better?\\nR:\\tIt sounds like it’s breaking up. \\n[Dealing with technical issues.]\\nI:\\tSo, how old are you?\\nR:\\tI’m 47.\\nI:\\tAnd then what day when you born?\\nR:\\tNovember 12th, 1969.\\nI:\\tWhere were you born?\\nR:\\tLowell, Massachusetts.\\nI:\\tAnd are you a US citizen?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tWhat is your gender?\\nR:\\tMale. \\nI:\\tAnd please choose from the list that I’m going to read to you the category or categories that best describe how you self-identify in terms of race.\\nR:\\tCaucasian.\\nI:\\tAnd please choose from this list how others perceive you in terms of race and ethnicity?\\nR:\\tCaucasian. Sorry. I don’t have a lot of patience for that shit.\\nI:\\tThat’s fine. And what is your present marital status?\\nR:\\tSingle.\\nI:\\tSingle, never married?\\nR:\\tSingle, never married. Correct.\\nI:\\tAnd how many children do you have?\\nR:\\tNone.\\nI:\\tAnd what is the highest level of education that you’ve completed?\\nR:\\tFour years of college.\\nI:\\tAnd then check all that apply. How do you support yourself financially; no support, job or jobs--\\nR:\\tJob.\\nI:\\tSupport from family?\\nR:\\tNo. No support except for my job.\\nI:\\tOkay. About how much money do you earn? \\nR:\\tI’m in sales, so I’d says on average about $300,000 [inaudible 15:45].\\nI:\\tAnd that’s per year?\\nR:\\tIn the ballpark, yeah. I mean, it fluctuates a little bit. But yeah, in the ballpark.\\nI:\\tAnd so I would assume for the next question--what is your total household income--that you would fall into the category, then--\\nR:\\tThe same.\\nI:\\tSo now we’re going to move to talk about a little bit about relationships and social support. I am going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationship with family. And to clarify, “family” means blood or legal relative and significant others, or guardians. \\nR:\\tGot it.\\nI:\\tSo the first question is “I feel close to my family.” Strongly agree? Agree? Neutral? Disagree? Or strongly disagree?\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“I want my family to be involved in my life.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree. Not all of them. Not every member, but yes. [Laugh]\\nI:\\t[Laugh]\\nR:\\tNot [inaudible 16:45] family, so--\\nI:\\tYes, yes. “I consider myself a source of support for my family.”\\nR:\\tHow do you define that?\\nI:\\tI mean, I guess it’s pretty open in terms of I guess it could be financial support, emotional support; but do you feel that you provide your family with any kind of support?\\nR:\\tEmotional support, I think. Yeah.\\nI:\\tOkay. And is that agree, or strongly agree?\\nR:\\tStrongly agree, yeah.\\nI:\\tAnd then, I guess on the flip side, do you feel your family is a source of support for you? Again, either financial or emotional?\\nR:\\tStrongly agree. Always going to be emotion[?] in that way. So I’d say strongly agree.\\nI:\\t“I fight a lot with my family members.”\\nR:\\tNo. Strongly disagree.\\nI:\\t“I often feel like I disappoint my family.”\\nR:\\tUmm … disagree. [Inaudible 17:56] one family [inaudible] family. It could be one person in the family that disagree … that you butt heads with. So I would say the other one would be disagree, as opposed to strongly disagree. Because [inaudible] family is all-encompassing. So all it takes is one bad apple and your family-- Anyway. Skew the results.\\nI:\\tAnd then the last question is, “I am criticized a lot by my family.”\\nR:\\tI am what?\\nI:\\tCriticized a lot by my family. \\nR:\\tI’d say strong disagree. I’d say disagree. Disagree. There is one person in the family that’s kind of … anyway.\\nI:\\tAnd it sounds like for the most part you have a very good relationship, but then there are maybe one or two individuals you’re not as close to.\\nR:\\tWell, it’s a brother who is … he is also an addict. But he’s a dry drunk. So, yeah; you could surmise that. And I get along with them, to a degree. But he also … he can be … it’s like dealing with a child at times.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. Thank you for elaborating. Again, we’re going to have the same scale here about your family. So then, “I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\tAnd how many people would you say?\\nR:\\tUmm … I have a small family, so … I would say … three.\\nI:\\tOkay, and then, “I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.”\\nR:\\tUmm, two. [Inaudible 19:50] two. [Laugh]\\nI:\\tAnd is that an agree or a strongly agree?\\nR:\\tUmm, I would say strongly agree.\\nI:\\tOkay. “I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.”\\nR:\\tUmm … agree.\\nI:\\tAnd then it’s going to be the same; how many?\\nR:\\tTwo.\\nI:\\t“I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job.”\\nR:\\tI would say strongly agree, and I would say one. Well, advice that I would take. [Laugh] I would get a lot of advice, but the advice I would take would probably be from one of them.\\nI:\\tYes, okay; I can understand that. [Laugh] “I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem.”\\nR:\\tUmm, I would say--yeah, strongly agree. Two.\\nI:\\t“I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed.”\\nR:\\tThey’re not … I’m in California and they’re not. So, zero. Disagree.\\nI:\\tBut if you were in the same geographic area?\\nR:\\tOh, yeah. I would say strongly agree. I would say three. If [inaudible 21:30] we’re all [inaudible]. [Inaudible.] Yeah.\\nI:\\tAnd then, “I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support if needed.”\\nR:\\tUmm … I’m trying to think about this. Agree. I would probably say one.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. All right. So going on to a little bit more deeper into those, family and friends can have an important source of support, but they can also be an influence on us to do things that are may not in our best interests, or kind of--as you alluded to-- some of the bad apples can be just a source of stress. So can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends--both ones that you would consider a good, supportive relationship and then also one that you would consider bad, or destructive, or stressful?\\nR:\\tI don’t want to talk about that.\\nI:\\tOkay. That is more than fine. So then we’re moving to questions that are about relationships outside of your family. Can you think about three people to whom you feel closest personally, such as friends? And so again, this is outside of your family.\\nR:\\tThe one before was family?\\nI:\\tIt was family or friends.\\nR:\\tWell, with family I will answer that. That’s fine.\\nI:\\tOkay. \\nR:\\tHow long will it take?\\nI:\\tThis is open-ended. You’re the driver here.\\nR:\\tA good relationship, I’d say my mom and my sister. It’s more of … the relationship has evolved. They know everything about my addiction, as does my brother. But they are more calm, and grounded. I can turn to them for things. I don’t really ask a lot of advice, but I can be very candid with them about things in my life.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\tMy brother, we have some similarities. We’re both addicts. He’s been sober from drugs for a number of years, but he’s effectively a dry drunk [inaudible 24:02]. And that impacts the ability … you know, his emotional maturity is kind of stunted because of that. And it has impacted our relationship, you know? \\nI just started to establish boundaries, then, because … you know, some things he’s done I don’t agree with, and he doesn’t like it. [Inaudible 24:24], like training a dog. But it’s impacted. The boundaries are very helpful for me, and where I am in my recovery--that I just don’t [inaudible 24:35]. You know, whether he’s kind of abusive towards me, but if he’s talking negative about someone else in the family, I don’t want to hear it. \\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nI do not want to hear it. Not for nothing.\\nI:\\tSo it sounds like your mom and your sister are people that you feel like you can go to, to talk to. And your relationship with your brother is one that’s fine--but you’ve set up boundaries to kind of keep that relationship as … manageable.\\nR:\\tYeah, exactly. I would say that there’s a trust issue. I really don’t trust him. I don’t trust his intent on things. I think he has a good heart in there. When you’re an addictive mindset--the addiction not only … addition is not just the act of doing that behavior; it’s also the spirtual--or lack of spiritual--component in your life [inaudible]. So, any who.\\nI:\\tOne clarification question--and I apologize for my ignorance--but you’ve mentioned a few times; I think you’ve referred to your brother as a “dry drunk.” Can you explain what that means?\\nR:\\tYou never heard the term “dry drunk?” Do you have any alcoholics in your family?\\nI:\\tI do. \\nR:\\tSo dry drunk--this is a common terminology--is somebody who might not be doing the act of using drugs or alcohol, or whatever it is. But their emotional maturity is that of a child. It’s like walking on eggshells around them. \\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tThey behave … they might not be using. The addiction itself is about … the thing about it is the addiction itself is about the character defects and character flaws [inaudible 26:25] of doing it. Part of spiritual recovery is bringing a higher power--god--into your life. People who are dry drunks, they’re not doing that. They are the center of the universe. They control everything. It’s still very self-centered [inaudible 26:44]. The difference is that they not using drugs or alcohol [inaudible 26:49], right?\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay, thank you. Yeah, that makes sense in [inaudible 26:53] how you’re speaking to your relationship with your brother really makes sense in kind of filling that out as well. So, thank you for the clarification.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tSo we are going to start talking about relationships outside of your family. And it sounded like you weren’t comfortable with that. So I will--\\nR:\\t[Inaudible 27:15] We can just go for [inaudible].\\nI:\\tGreat. So how many friends--up to three, outside of your family--do you feel closest to?\\nR:\\tHow many?\\nI:\\tFrom zero to three, yeah.\\nR:\\tI would say four or five.\\nI:\\tAnd then we’re going to go through kind of-- If we could talk descriptively about three of your friends; not with names or anything. But if you have three friends in mind, for that third friend--is that friend a male or female?\\nR:\\tUmm, female.\\nI:\\tAnd then how would you describe her race or ethnicity?\\nR:\\tAsian.\\nI:\\tAnd then what is her age?\\nR:\\tUmm, mid-30s; mid, early 30s or something like that. And she is [inaudible 28:17] right now.\\nI:\\tAnd do you know what the highest level of education is that she has completed?\\nR:\\tUmm, four-year college I believe.\\nI:\\tAnd then do you know is she currently employed for pay?\\nR:\\tYeah. Very good job.\\nI:\\tI’m sorry; I cut you off--you were saying something about her education?\\nR:\\tShe might have a graduate degree. I’m not sure.\\nI:\\tOkay, and do you know if she is receiving any public aid?\\nR:\\tNo, she makes very good money.\\nI:\\tOkay. And is she married or living with a partner?\\nR:\\tNo. She’s single.\\nI:\\tAnd then the same set of questions for that second friend. Is it male or a female?\\nR:\\tI would say … I have probably seven, eight friends. But I don’t want to go through all of them.\\nI:\\tWe’re just going through three.\\nR:\\tThe second one would be a guy. The exact same thing; he supports himself. No public aid. Four-year college.\\nI:\\tOkay. And then what would you say is his age?\\nR:\\tUmm, early 40s?\\nI:\\tOkay. And then, again, race and ethnicity?\\nR:\\tWhite. \\nI:\\tAnd then is he married or living with a partner?\\nR:\\tSingle. Single. And then the third one would be retired, collecting pension. Maybe social security, I think. Married. \\nI:\\tAnd is that a male or female?\\nR:\\tMale, sorry. \\nI:\\tNo worries.\\nR:\\tCaucasian.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. Thank you. \\nI:\\tSo now we’re moving away from friends. I’m going to ask you some questions about groups and organizations you may be part of, and whether you receive support from those groups--either material or emotional.\\nR:\\tThis connection really sucks. It’s distracting.\\nI:\\tThank you for letting me know.\\n[Technical difficulties.]\\n[*end SF657, part 1 - begin SF657, part 2*] \\n[Note: timestamps restart at 00:00]\\nI:\\tIs this any better?\\nR:\\tNot really. But I don’t want to do this all night.\\nI:\\tOkay. At any point you can stop me and then we can schedule another time. Very weird.\\nR:\\tThere’s no intent behind it. It’s just the way it is. Anyway, let’s go.\\nI:\\tOkay. So we’re going to talk about some of your affiliations, and then talking about whether you feel like you’ve received emotional or material supports. So emotional support, you know--\\nR:\\tThere’s no material support. We can get that out of the way.\\nI:\\tSo then we can talk, I guess, just in terms of emotional supports. I’m going to walk through a few organizations and you’re going to let me know if you participate in them. So the first is church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious--\\nR:\\tNot in many, many years.\\nI:\\tOkay. Recreational club?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tSports team?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tMusic or artist group?\\nR:\\tUmm, no.\\nI:\\tCrew or a gang?\\nR:\\tWhat?\\nI:\\tLike, a crew or a gang?\\nR:\\t[Laugh] No gang affiliation for [inaudible 2:07]. \\nI:\\tAny local government group?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tCivic associations?\\nR:\\tThere’s no groups I belong to, except … just to make it easy for you. There’s no groups I belong to. The only thing I am part of is a 12-step program for my sex addiction.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. Thank you. And how often do you participate in this support group?\\nR:\\tWeekly I go to … I don’t call it a support group. It’s a 12 … well--\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tIt’s a 12-step program.\\nI:\\tIt’s a program. Okay.\\nR:\\tI don’t like the word “support.” If you put it under the category of recovery program, 12-step recovery program.\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tI go to meetings probably two to three times a week.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And so do you feel like you are able to turn to this group for emotional support?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tAnd you said not for financial support. \\nR:\\tCorrect.\\nI:\\tDo you feel comfortable elaborating about some of the emotional support you feel like you can receive from the group or have received in the past?\\nR:\\tUmm, yeah. They have an intimate relationship [inaudible 3:19] emotional [inaudible] talk about things that come up for me, being an addict. I mean, additionally, vice-versa; they’re people I can relate to because they have the same commonalities I do, which is … they’ve had an unmanageability around their sex addiction. So we share the commonality. A 12-step program is not a support group; it’s [inaudible 3:45].\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tIt’s a spiritual foundation, a process for recovery.\\nI:\\tOkay. And it sounds like what you’re saying is not only are you able to receive support from them, but since it’s a shared experience that you’re able to provide support as well. So it’s kind of a two-way [inaudible 4:05] relationship.\\nR:\\tCorrect. Right. I mean, the way a 12-step program works is you have the program, and then you have the fellowship. The program itself is kind of the framework of recovery; the 12 steps that you work through with a sponsor. And then the fellowship is kind of … basically the people inside it that you communicate with.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\t[Inaudible 4:28]. We [inaudible].\\nI:\\tOkay. Great, thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tSo we’re hopping around again. So a few questions about your employment history.\\nR:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. \\nI:\\tSo how old were you when you had your first job?\\nR:\\tUmm … first job … 14.\\nI:\\tAnd how much of your adult life would you you’ve been employed–all, most--\\nR:\\tAll. I was unemployed for brief periods of time. Very short periods of time. But yeah, I’ve been employed my whole time. \\nI:\\tAnd can you just briefly describe what skills you bring to the labor market, and how you?\\nR:\\tI mean, I’m in sales, and--\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tAnd in sales, the essence of that is going to be communication. \\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\tHow did I learn that? Just from … I’m a social person. I mean, I’m a social person. I think it’s interpersonal skills, and … you know, things come in ebbs and flows in terms of [inaudible 5:44]. \\nI:\\tAnd are there other skills that you’re--for your current job, I guess, or maybe future that you are trying to learn now or that you’re hoping to learn in the future?\\nR:\\tNot particularly. I mean, you know what? Possibly. I do photography on the side.\\nI:\\tOh, cool.\\nR:\\tAnd eventually-- Oh, that’s my passion. I [inaudible 6:07] connect to art galleries. If I could eventually monetize that, I would do that in a heartbeat.\\nI:\\tYeah.\\nR:\\tBut I’m not going to hold my breath. If I had somebody who is connected who could make introductions for me, I would. But I just need to put together a portfolio. So I would say that skill, in terms of that would be a skill--learning how to continue to do things with photography. I’m very creative, but I can always get better in what I do. So a skillset in terms of outside of what I do on a day-in, day-out basis.\\nI:\\tThat’s really cool. I would imagine that this … The friends I have in the sales world, it’s very intense and can be stressful. So I imagine having a creative outlet is a nice balance to that, to your nine-to-five day.\\nR:\\tYeah. I’m passionate about health and fitness. I work out a lot. And I’m also passionate about photography. I have a regular camera with very nice lenses, but I do most of my pictures candidly, during the day or during the week. Or on my phone. I have the iPhone 7 Plus, which is awesome.\\nI:\\tI’ve heard that that’s pretty amazing. That’s cool. That’s awesome. I wish you the best of luck with that.\\nR:\\tThanks. I appreciate it.\\nI:\\tI’m going to walk you through a few possible barriers to employment and just ask you to tell me if any of these have ever occurred; if you’ve ever faced any of these in terms of barriers to employment. The first is education, training, or experience?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tTransportation?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tFamilial obligations?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tLack of available jobs?\\nR:\\tUmm, when I’ve been laid off … yeah. I mean, I wasn’t laid off for long, but available jobs that I liked. [Laugh] There is a bit of a caveat to that.\\nI:\\tSo available jobs that were in your interest area and where your skills are. That makes sense. Employer discrimination?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tCriminal record?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tSubstance abuse?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tDomestic violence?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tMental and/or physical health?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tHomeless/housing instability?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tAny others that I didn’t cover?\\nR:\\tNo. But I would say that I did lose a job indirectly because--two jobs. I believe, indirectly, because of my addiction. So I don’t know if that would classify in any of your categories. Not directly, but more indirectly. Indirectly. Not directly.\\nI:\\tDo you feel comfortable elaborating on what you mean by indirect?\\nR:\\tWhen I lived in Boston, I was in my addiction--before I really started working the program. I was just angry. I would stay up late. While I wasn’t using a physical substance, the sex addiction--the chemicals in your body. I acted like a child. Eventually I got fired, because I just blew up at somebody. And I would say that the other one, I was … you know, I think I wasn’t as productive as I could have been because I was in my addiction, frankly. So I think that would be accurate.\\nI:\\tThe addiction is affecting how you perform at work.\\nR:\\tIt did.\\nI:\\tAnd work performance is kind of what determines if you’re keeping a job or not. Yeah, I think that that’s pretty--\\nR:\\tI’m not saying that the results would have been different, but I think I would have had better results had I not been in the addiction.\\nI:\\tGreat. Thank you for sharing. And you said you work in sales. Do you have just one job?\\nR:\\tI have one.\\nI:\\tAre then are you comfortable sharing what your current job title is?\\nR:\\tVice-president. It’s a generally baseless[?] title.\\nI:\\tAnd then when did you begin that job?\\nR:\\tMy existing?\\nI:\\tYes.\\nR:\\tMy existing … existing job I started in 2012.\\nI:\\tI assume that it’s full-time?\\nR:\\tCorrect.\\nI:\\tAnd then did you find this job? \\nR:\\tReferral. Referral through a former colleague. Through LinkedIn. It was from a former colleague. He got it through LinkedIn.\\nI:\\tAnd you already said that you earn about $300,000 a year.\\nR:\\tIn that ballpark.\\nI:\\tWe’ve already answered these questions. I’m going to skip ahead. Is the job that you currently have now--is that typical of what you’ve been doing in the past? Have you been working in sales previously at this high a level?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tCan you just give me a general overview of the types of jobs you’ve had, and your experience in the job market--and the type of work you’ve done prior to this job?\\nR:\\tI’ve had other sales jobs. I mean, I started off in service when I graduated from college. I’ve had jobs for a long time, for the most part.\\nI:\\tYes; since 14 I believe you said.\\nR:\\tYeah. But I would say after college I’ve had jobs for a long time. One company I was at for I think four years. The next one I was at for three. The next one for eleven. And then this one. I mean, there really haven’t been many.\\nI:\\tIt sounds like you keep, I feel like. That’s not the generational thing everyone has; 11 years, that’s great. You don’t hear that as much these days.\\nR:\\tDepending on the field you work in and the industry. I mean, tech--these people don’t stay as long, probably. In perpetuity.\\nI:\\tCan you tell me about what you would consider your most positive work experience, and what made that experience so positive?\\nR:\\tMy most positive work experience was when I … the job before this. Well, the same company, but initially when I got to the company, for several years it was a start-up within a big company. And it was a product that was incredibly innovative. It was amazing. It basically became a Harvard case study.\\nI:\\tThat’s cool. Wow.\\nR:\\tIt was pretty amazing.\\nI:\\tThat’s amazing, to be a part of that.\\nR:\\tAbsolutely. I completely agree.\\nI:\\tThat’s really cool. And on the flip side, can you tell me about your most negative work experience?\\nR:\\tYeah. I’m trying to think. My most negative one I think was doing customer service. I got very burnt out doing it. That’s also when I got fired. I was unhappy doing it. I had done it for too long.\\nI:\\tYou referred to that job earlier as well in the interview. Correct?\\nR:\\tYeah.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else you want to add about your work?\\nR:\\tNot really. I travel. My last two jobs--two, three--I’ve traveled with them. I traveled, which can be exhausting. Being exhausted is for many addicts what is called a trigger. That puts you at a place of being in discomfort, and we’re looking for comfort. I need to be in a spiritually grounded place, and get rest when I’m like that.\\nI:\\tYou said your previous jobs involved a lot of travel. Does that mean you’re not traveling as frequently with your current job?\\nR:\\tI’m choosing not to. I really don’t need to do that as much. Although just recently I just made the decision [inaudible 15:54] business where I’m at right now, and from a sanity standpoint.\\nI:\\tThat’s good. Great. Now we’re moving on about asking you questions about experiences you’ve had with substance abuse, if any.\\nR:\\tNone. None.\\nI:\\tThat’s what I thought. So let me skip those. And now I’m going to ask you some questions about your mental and/or emotional health. Again, these are all going to be kept private. You don’t have to answer anything that you’re not comfortable with.\\nR:\\tSounds good.\\nI:\\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professional that you have a mental or emotional condition or that you show symptoms of a mental or emotional condition?\\nR:\\tNo. Not outside of my addiction. No.\\nI:\\tIs your addiction diagnosed by a professional?\\nR:\\tOh, yeah.\\nI:\\tWhat was your diagnosis?\\nR:\\tSex addiction.\\nI:\\tSo in addition to that addiction, have you ever yourself thought you’ve had an emotional or a mental health condition that was not diagnosed?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tHave you ever taken medicine prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of an emotional or mental condition?\\nR:\\tSorry. I’m munching on food.\\nI:\\tNo, you’re fine.\\nR:\\tYes. Here’s the thing. The only condition I had, I still have. I was diagnosed when I was probably 14 or 15 with Tourette’s. My psychologist [says?] that impacts my addiction. It’s part of Tourette’s impulsivity. \\nFor me, I did take medication for it until four or five years ago. It just made me tired. And the Tourette’s has lessened as I’ve gotten older. I also took medication for depression [and for?] ADD. I stopped taking it altogether, because I don’t really think I had those conditions. I think it was more … I mean, maybe I have borderline ADD. But the side effects of all these things was … it wasn’t worth the … Drug companies love you to take them, right? So they don’t legalize marijuana.\\nBy the way, on a side note, I don’t smoke weed. But drug companies and alcohol companies are the ones, basically, who are against legalizing marijuana because it takes money away from them. That’s a side note. I don’t smoke. Anyway. People who are using that, they’re not going to be taking stuff for depression. Go figure.\\nI:\\tThat’s interesting, and not something that’s in the discourse that’s around legalization at all.\\nR:\\tIf you do a Google for it, maybe you’ll find the drug companies or the amount of drug sales that have fallen in states that have legalized marijuana.\\nI:\\tThat’s super-interesting. I’m definitely going to look into that. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tThen, the next question is have you ever been admitted to a mental hospital, unit, or treatment program where you’ve stayed overnight because of an emotional or mental condition?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tThen have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional?\\nR:\\tYes. I see a psychologist now.\\nI:\\tIs that a helpful--\\nR:\\tVery helpful. Very helpful. I get more out of it in the space that I’m in now. Being in the addiction itself, it’s somewhat helpful--but you get more out of it when you’re present and not in an unconscious state, as Eckhart Tolle would say. So when I’m present I get a lot more out of everything that I do.\\nI:\\tDid you self-elect to go to counseling? Or is this court-ordered, or required under your program?\\nR:\\tSelf-elected. Self-elected.\\nI:\\tHow long have you been in therapy?\\nR:\\tA long time. A long, long time. I mean, since I was a kid.\\nI:\\tThe next question, it says do you feel like you have an emotional or mental health condition now? And so you’ve talked about your addiction. Is there anything else?\\nR:\\tNo. I [inaudible 21:17] it anymore. I think you have some insanity when you’re in your addiction, candidly.\\nI:\\tCan you talk a little bit about how you’ve seen your emotional or mental concerns change over the years? You talked a little bit about your Tourette’s and your medication. Is there any other change you’ve seen over the course of your life?\\nR:\\tI grew up also with a learning disability, too. I’d put that in there as well. I would just say that I think over the course of time I’ve adjusted to having a learning disability, I have learning comprehension. So I probably have to slow down and just stop and read and take notes. I’m a visual person in many ways. That’s what I’d say.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else on the topic of mental and emotional health you want to add or talk more about?\\nR:\\tNot really. The other thing is from a physical standpoint just … I’m not sure if we’re going to get to it. I had testicular cancer 17 years ago.\\nI:\\tI’m sorry to hear that.\\nR:\\tNo, it’s fine.\\nI:\\tWow. I’m sure that was very difficult.\\nR:\\tIt was not easy. Looking back on it, I think I was going through denial that pertained to myself. But it was a lot. When I look back on it. It was a traumatic experience.\\nI:\\tYeah. Wow. Are you in remission now?\\nR:\\tYeah. Now I’m cured; 17 years ago.\\nI:\\tThat’s good. That must have been very difficult to deal with.\\nR:\\tIt was not easy. No.\\nI:\\tThen we’re going to move to the next section, which is we’re going to talk about experiences with the criminal justice system. And first, with starting about learning more about interactions that you may have had with the police. As with some of the others, again, these are sensitive and emotional and you’re not required to answer anything. Please stop me at any point.\\nR:\\tBefore you do that, I’ll let you know that through the grace of something bigger than me, I went through first-time offenders program twice. So I was arrested twice over I think 12 years between the two things; 11 or 12 years between the two things. The courts allowed me to go through it a second time.\\nI:\\tYou were an adult at both of those arrests?\\nR:\\tYeah.\\nI:\\tOr was one you were a juvenile?\\nR:\\tNo. Adult.\\nI:\\tWhat were the specific offenses for which you were arrested?\\nR:\\tSolicitation.\\nI:\\tBoth times. Correct?\\nR:\\tYeah. Correct.\\nI:\\tAnd then how old were you at the time of your first arrest?\\nR:\\tI was 31 or 32. The second one would be 44, 45. Something like that.\\nI:\\tAnd then can you describe for me the event of your arrest, from the moment you were approached by officers, and then taken into custody--and then walking through arraignment, assuming you were arraigned.\\nR:\\tNo. I was never. Are you smoking a cigarette, by the way?\\nI:\\tYeah.\\nR:\\tI can tell.\\nI:\\tOh, you asked if I was. Oh, no. I’m not.\\nR:\\tYou’re not? It sounded like you were. Never mind.\\nI:\\tI thought you were asking my permission. I was like, “Sure.”\\nR:\\tNo, no. I don’t smoke. I have very sensitive hearing, so I pick up everything. Sorry. I’m quirky like that. \\nThere were two times I was arrested. The first time, I was soliciting somebody on the street, whatever. Yeah. I was soliciting someone. Then I was handcuffed. I was handcuffed and walked down to … It was a sting operation. Both of these situations were sting operations. I had walked to a parking lot. They told me about most likely going to a first-time offenders program. This was back in 2011 or 2012. One of the two. \\nAnd then, the second time … and the police were fair both times. They were not abusive in any way, shape, or form. I was in my program to begin with at the time. This was in relapse.\\nI was never arraigned. There was no arraignment. I could either contest it--which I would have gone to court--or I would have the charges dropped if I went to the first-time offenders program, which I went through twice. \\nAnd the first time was soliciting someone in the street. The second one was going to a hotel after contacting someone through Backpage[?]. They’re no longer doing their ads anymore. But contacting people that way. [Inaudible 26:46] sting operation in the hotel room and I was just … Yeah. That’s what happened.\\nI:\\tYou said that the police treated you fairly.\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tJust give me what makes you feel like they treated you fairly? If you can describe that.\\nR:\\tThe first time, I can’t really remember. But they weren’t going, “You fucking idiot.” They were not abusive. Second time, I was distraught. I was just I fucked up; I am so sorry.\\nThis was where I was at. And I broke down. And they were just like--no, it’ll be okay. Don’t worry. There are worse things you could have done. So they were somewhat empathetic. Not empathetic, but … I mean, I still broke the law, of course.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. So were you taken into custody? Were you held in jail?\\nR:\\tNo. No. No. Not this time.\\nI:\\tSo you were not booked. So they released you after taking you into custody, but never booking you.\\nR:\\tRight. The charges were dropped. Arrest, but no charges.\\nI:\\tThen, sorry, to confirm, you’ve never actually been convicted?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tBecause of the court diversion program.\\nR:\\tThey were showing as arrests. I had an attorney change them to detainments. Now it’s detainments. And then there are a couple things I’m doing, and then he’s going to get the record sealed. We’re working to try to get the record sealed.\\nI:\\tThere may be a question about this later, too, but did you have a private lawyer or did you have a public defender?\\nR:\\tPrivate.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else you want to say about that? About your arrests?\\nR:\\tNo. There’s not much to say about it. They were fair. I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to go through the first-time offenders program, rather than just being booked. If it happened in any other place, a lot of other places I wouldn’t have been as fortunate. Also, the fact that I was able to go through the first-time offenders program twice. I was extremely fortunate.\\nI:\\tThose were both in San Francisco?\\nR:\\tCorrect.\\nI:\\tAnd just in terms of … they released you upon the kind of everything is dropped based on the assumption that you go through and complete the program? That if something--\\nR:\\tYou have to complete the program. And then that’s when officially the charges are dropped, basically. The second time I also had to go to the community thing, and basically sit down with people from the community and write out the impact that my addiction has on the community and [inaudible 29:59].\\nI:\\tCan you explain what is the “community” that you were … can you explain a little bit more about what that process was like?\\nR:\\tThe community was just people who happened to live in a certain area. They basically got together. It was more formalized than the first time I went through it. The first time, there was not [inaudible 30:22].\\nBut then this time it was kind of a community; just people who lived in the neighborhood or they volunteered. They talked about the impact of this and they wanted me to write something about the impact of prostitution and trafficking. In other words, writing a report on what I’ve learned about the impact of prostitution on everybody.\\nI:\\tHow was that experience for you?\\nR:\\tIt was good. I think it’s important to go through, candidly.\\nI:\\tWhy? Can you explain a little bit on why you think it’s important?\\nR:\\tWell, I think it’s important to recognize the impact our addiction has on people.\\nI:\\tGreat. That’s helpful. Thank you. So, the same as with law enforcement. I’m going to ask you some questions … I am going to read you some statements and ask you to describe how you may feel about legal authorities. And so again, this is going to be the scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. “I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.”\\nR:\\tImpacting me or impacting everybody else? What’s the context?\\nI:\\tIt’s up to your interpretation. I read this, “I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.”\\nR:\\tI, personally.\\nI:\\tPersonally. Yeah.\\nR:\\tWell, only as it pertains to me, I would say most of the time--yes. From my experience, yes. I do. That’s just my experience. But I think legal authorities make mistakes. Absolutely. Because they’re human beings. They’re going to make mistakes.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And so for you, personally, you said maybe somewhat agree? Or strongly agree?\\nR:\\tSomewhat agree.\\nI:\\tThen, if you’re talking about the broader global context, it would maybe be--\\nR:\\tFor me, it would be strongly agree. And the global context, agree.\\nI:\\tOkay. “People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“It is difficult to break the law and keep one’s self-respect.”\\nR:\\tCompletely agree. Totally agree. Whatever that falls into. Sorry.\\nI:\\tCan you elaborate a little bit there?\\nR:\\tYou’ve just got to do what’s right. What I mean by that is if you’re doing something that violates your basic … How can you feel good about yourself--unless you really compartmentalize things--if you do things that go against a true self[?]? It’s going to … I can speak for myself. It impacts my self-esteem and how I feel about myself.\\nI:\\tI understand that. “The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me.”\\nR:\\tPeople in power. Yeah. Strongly agree.\\nI:\\t“People in power use the law to control people like me.”\\nR:\\tAgree.\\nI:\\tSomewhat agree or strongly agree?\\nR:\\tSomewhat agree.\\nI:\\t“The law does not protect my interests.”\\nR:\\tDisagree.\\nI:\\tStrongly or somewhat?\\nR:\\tSomewhat.\\nI:\\t“Most police in my city do their job well.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“Most police in my city treat people with respect.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“The basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“The police in my city have too much power.”\\nR:\\tStrongly disagree.\\nI:\\tAnd, “most police in my city treat some people better than others.”\\nR:\\tI don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say to that. I would say … I don’t know what to say to that. It would be incorrect for me to … And I think for all the police … I’m just doing it based on my own inherent knowledge or bias.\\nI:\\tI can put you down for neither agree nor disagree.\\nR:\\tCool.\\nI:\\tCool. It seems like overall of kind of positive feelings, at least in your personal experience, about law enforcement and the way that they both conduct themselves and their governing. And how they’re operated. But then you also expressed some concerns about power; the people in power dictate what the laws are, which may, from what I would infer from what you said, may sometimes be in line with your values but maybe sometimes may not. Is that the correct summation of your answering?\\nR:\\tI think that’s fair to say.\\nI:\\tGreat. Have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questions, physically threatened, abused, or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tI’m not turning my pages as fast. To what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with the police?\\nR:\\tWhat do you mean? Should I say “agree,” “strongly disagree”?\\nI:\\tNo. It’s just open-ended. To what extent, and how? Then if you can explain how you think race has affected your interactions with the police.\\nR:\\tI’m white, so I don’t think it’s impacted me at all. I don’t have probably the inherent biases a lot of people would, based on my own experiences per se.\\nI:\\tYou said you don’t have inherent biases? Or the police don’t have inherent biases towards you? Which--?\\nR:\\tI think they don’t have inherent biases towards me if they’re white. I would say that, yeah. That’s what I would say. How much longer do we have, by the way? I’m getting really tired.\\nI:\\tWe still have a decent amount of questions.\\nR:\\tI’m not going to be able to get through the whole of this.\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tI can give you another ten minutes.\\nI:\\tUnderstandable. Let’s just move on. You were not detained pretrial.\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tThat is correct. Actually, we can skip a bunch of those. Sorry. I’m just trying to move through. So was your diversion program considered neighborhood court?\\nR:\\tYes. Yes. Yes. The second time.\\nI:\\tHow long is the neighborhood court program that you were in?\\nR:\\tA month. How long? I went and met once. I talked to them. Then I came back and I read the paper to them. That was it.\\nI:\\tThen, following your arrest, how did you support yourself financially?\\nR:\\tI still had a job.\\nI:\\tI want to ask you a bit about access to programs or services that you maybe had after your arrest and whether you found them helpful.\\nR:\\tThe only one I used was my program. That’s it. That’s the only program. I don’t want to be wasting your time. It’s the only program.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else you wish you had had in terms of access to services, or other things in addition to your program, post-arrest?\\nR:\\tUmm … The only other thing might be to … understanding about … I think the only [thing] is understanding about getting charges reduced or getting them eliminated. It was kind of gray. Getting things expunged. They talked about that very broadly, but I think it was not very clear.\\nI:\\tI was going to say, so kind of, because you were talking about going through the expungement process--and it sounds like most of that you’re doing on your own.\\nR:\\tRight. Mine is not going to be expunged. It’s going to become sealed. I don’t know what that’s called, when it’s sealed.\\nI:\\tBut that was not something that was covered. And also, post-arrest, can you tell me about your initial interactions with your family members?\\nR:\\tThey didn’t know about it.\\nI:\\tOkay, so it hasn’t affected your relationship with your family, since they didn’t know.\\nR:\\tRight.\\nI:\\tAlso, I guess, the same with friends. Were there friends that knew? And did this effect your relationship with friends?\\nR:\\tThe only people that knew were people in my program, and it did not impact it.\\nI:\\tYou do not have children. And it sounds like you were living in your same house and apartment.\\nR:\\tYeah.\\nI:\\tYour housing situation did not change.\\nR:\\tRight.\\nI:\\tI can skip through all of these housing. I guess maybe, I know since you only have a few minutes, can you just broadly talk about how you feel about your neighborhood that you live in? Is it a safe place to live?\\nR:\\tExtremely safe.\\nI:\\tDo you feel like it’s ... Is it hard to stay out of trouble in your neighborhood?\\nR:\\tHere’s the thing; I can get into trouble anywhere. So it’s not the neighborhood. I would say that your spiritual state is what impacts the quality of your sobriety. Neighborhood is immaterial. I would say if I lived in Tenderloin … I live in the Marina. But in the Tenderloin it might be a little different. But I would say in my existing spiritual state I’m not … I haven’t had thoughts of wanting to medicate with sex in over two months.\\nI:\\tOkay. Then I want to ask you a few questions. Again, you’re in power here; tell me when you’re done. About your experience in neighborhood court from the moment you entered the courtroom until you were dismissed.\\nR:\\tI never went to a courtroom. We can skip those. There’s no courtroom. No court.\\nI:\\tThat community program that you explained is basically you were--\\nR:\\tIt wasn’t a court. It was in lieu of court. I never went to court.\\nI:\\tYou walked me through what the proceedings were like. It was members of the community. How it made you feel.\\nR:\\tExactly. Yeah.\\nI:\\tGreat. Was there any supervision component of neighborhood court?\\nR:\\tNo. I don’t think so.\\nI:\\tSo you weren’t reporting to anyone while you were going through the process. It was more just making sure you would show up.\\nR:\\tThey were reporting whether I showed up or not.\\nI:\\tIs there any [inaudible 44:07]? I know you talked about you thought it was important to share here how--\\nR:\\tThey sent me. They suggested I do this. That was [inaudible busted me.\\nI:\\tIn terms of if there’s any other benefits from the program, from participating? I know you spoke about talking about this and hearing from the community members. Any personal relationship? I’m guessing not education or employment, but any other benefits?\\nR:\\tNo. No. No, no, no.\\nI:\\tWere there any negative consequences associated with your participation?\\nR:\\tNo. None. None.\\nI:\\tThen, can you tell me a little bit about the program, the other program for first offense? Did you get to know anyone as a result of being in the program?\\nR:\\tThere was not a program. It wasn’t a … I didn’t meet any other people who were arrested. I did not meet anybody else in the program. People who were in the first-time offenders program, I didn’t talk to anybody.\\nI:\\tYou did not talk to anybody?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tIs there anything you can say about staff of either the first-time offenders or the neighborhood court that you interacted with most? Were you actually interacting with staff as part of that?\\nR:\\tMinimally.\\nI:\\tIt doesn’t sound like anyone influenced your participation.\\nR:\\tNo. No.\\nI:\\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program?\\nR:\\tIt was uncomfortable. I don’t want to say it was difficult. It was just uncomfortable.\\nI:\\tCan you explain a little bit?\\nR:\\tBecause of the degree of shame. You’re there for a reason. You violated the law, so I think there’s a degree of probably shame that comes up.\\nI:\\tWere you ever accused of violating the conditions of the program?\\nR:\\tNo. No. No. No. Nope.\\nI:\\tI think you said earlier, but completion of the program was … You completed the program successfully, which was determined by completing that community meeting. Is that correct?\\nR:\\tYeah. Plus going to the first-time offenders program. There were two parts of it.\\nI:\\tHow did they notify you that you were done? Did you get anything formal?\\nR:\\tWhen you went through everything, you just got a little note saying I basically completed bla-bla-bla.\\nI:\\tThe charges were dismissed but the arrest was still on your record.\\nR:\\tIt was changed to a detainment, because of me getting an attorney.\\nI:\\tOkay. There are just maybe two or three more very quick ones. To what extent do you agree with the following? “Overall, the program was very helpful.”\\nR:\\tAgree.\\nI:\\tJust agree, not strongly agree?\\nR:\\tI would say strongly agree, just for shits and giggles.\\nI:\\t[laugh] And is there something that you can say in addition to what you said already about why you felt it was particularly helpful? Or if there was any particularly unhelpful or counterproductive parts?\\nR:\\tNone of this stuff got me sober. This program, if you’re not an addict, it might help you. If you’re an addict, maybe it helps you. It’s helpful in the extent as understanding the impact that our actions have on the community. It’s helpful to understand that. What I would say is, if someone is in denial about it, they’re probably going to think it’s horrible. For me, I realized exactly what I did. I know that I fucked up. That didn’t get me sober, in either case. It’s been a long, painful path for me to get to where I’ve got to.\\nI:\\tFrom what you’ve talked about from the group you’re in, and I forget the term that you used, the 12-step group, but that’s where you’ve gotten most of your support, as opposed to the neighborhood court program.\\nR:\\tWell, I mean it’s helpful information. I think I understand what they’re trying to do. And I’m glad they do it, because some people will do that and never get arrested again. Not only get arrested; but they’ll never do the activity again. I believe that a lot of people who do it are addicts and probably don’t stop doing it unless they … That’s my belief [inaudible 49:09]. Unless they get to a place where they’re ready to work a program as a spiritual recovery. For me, personally, I’m actually … it’s kind of coincidental you called today. Tomorrow I’m actually participating in the program. I’m actually speaking.\\nI:\\tGreat.\\nR:\\tTo my program. We have people come in there, and speak about [inaudible 49:36] and what we’ve been through. And that’s what I’m doing, and talking about our program as well from a different perspective than I experienced before. I’m grateful I had the opportunity to do that [inaudible 49:51]. And 99 percent of the people either A; are an addict, or, B; are not ready yet if they are. You know?\\nI would say most people … I believe, most people who pay for sex, it’s not a one-time thing. Although I could be wrong. But I would say 99 percent of the people are not ready to recover if they are addicts. And then hopefully [inaudible 50:18]. That’s it.\\nI:\\tI think the ten minutes is probably up. Is there anything else that you didn’t have the chance to say that you think is important to make sure you convey?\\nR:\\tWhat else do you need to know? Let me just ask you. If you could summarize other things without going through every question, what else do you need to know?\\nI:\\tThis is my very first interview, so I’m not as familiar with the docket, so I can’t run through it as quickly. I apologize. Were there any challenges? Anything specific about the program that you think either set you up for success, set you up for failure? From staffing, from the process itself, and if there are just other things that, in terms of your experience going through this program, how that kind of affected you in your life today.\\nR:\\tWell, I had it probably … a little different for me than probably other people, because I knew I was a sex addict when I was arrested both times. It was not a surprise to me. I would say that because … I thought it was very good talking, talking about the impact that it has on people in society. I think it’s very important doing that. I believe that. That’s me, personally. It was good knowledge for me. It was. I won’t say it wasn’t. It was. Now, did I know all that stuff? No. I didn’t. Did that help get me sober? No. Because I’m an addict. So I had to hit my bottom before I got to a place of where I’m at now. So you know, it’s been my addiction. I’ll just be very candid with you. My addiction was paying for sex from … Then, when I got arrested the first time, I’m like--I’m never going to solicit anyone on the street again. I’m just going to use Backpage or whatever. No problem.\\nI’m just going to tell you my quick story, just so you understand. I’ve been through a lot with my life and my addiction. My addiction led to me going to a hotel and getting beaten up by a pimp, in addition to getting arrested twice. Then going to--okay. I’m not going to go to a hotel. I’m going to have people come to me. So I wasn’t getting arrested. I got beaten up by a pimp. I got robbed at the same time. It’s the nature of the addiction. It takes you a lot of places. Not some places, but places nonetheless. \\nThen I would say that I went to a place the last couple years where I’m not using the newspapers but then going to sugar daddy websites. Which was the same thing. It was manipulating young women who were in college who had, because of college, who had a lot of debt. Basically do what I wanted. Lying to them, telling them that I wanted something ongoing when I didn’t. Having them believing and feeling that it wasn’t transactional, but [inaudible 54:01] transactional. I would have unprotected sex with a lot of women. I’d give them a lot of money. I was [inaudible 54:05] them. \\nFor me, ultimately, that was my bottom. I felt so [inaudible 54:10] about myself and everything that I was doing, manipulating. For me, it didn’t feel … I was like, it’s different than Backpages; these aren’t really full-time prostitutes.\\nNo, they weren’t. These are people basically who probably were, I imagine, were abused probably sometime in their life. Any woman who turns to selling their body probably has been abused some time in their life. That’s what happens.\\nMaybe they have never been sexually abused, but they’ve had some sort of abuse. They have to, to get to this point. There has to be some sort of self-esteem … People don’t [inaudible 54:52] really high self-esteem, who sell their body. \\nThat was my bottom, which I needed to hit. I eventually got to finally a place of really seeing the impact it had on these women. I’m sure it had on other people, but especially for the women who are not full-time prostitutes. But it’s still prostitution. I’m still paying for something. I was getting something. [Inaudible 55:19]. Anyway. That wasn’t part of the thing, but I just wanted to add context to how I got to where I got to today.\\nI:\\tThank you. I really appreciate you sharing that. I know it probably can be difficult to share. But I do appreciate it. The last thing is just if there’s any feedback you have--either for me; I guess questions, one, if there’s any feedback you have in terms of what we talked about today. They’re obviously sensitive, and can be sensitive and uncomfortable. Do you have any suggestions for how we might ask these questions more effectively? Or just make the process better? We welcome any feedback you have.\\nR:\\tI would say for you, it’s your first time going through it, which I understand. Group the questions together. Ad that you need to kind of say … framing it out and saying, “I have eight sets of questions. These are what they deal with.” Frame it out. I’m a control freak, so it helps me to know how many sets of questions you have.\\nI:\\tThat makes sense.\\nR:\\tThe other thing is, understand, especially if they’re not “agree, strongly, agree,” if they’re freeform, is understanding what the questions are. You could ask me; hey, this one is dealing with this--tell me about these kinds of things.\\nI:\\tOkay. Thank you. That’s super-helpful. And I appreciate your patience. I know it is a long interview, and it is my first time. I really appreciate your patience.\\nR:\\tYou got me on a good day. I’m an inpatient person. You got me on a good day. I’m just tired. I get grumpy when I get tired.\\nI:\\tIt’s Friday. It’s Friday. I understand. The last thing is that we are required to ask is, to help us get in touch with you about any questions, we also like to see if you’re willing to provide information on family members and friends if we can’t get in touch with you?\\nR:\\tNo. Absolutely not.\\nI:\\tOkay. Thank you very much, [Name], for your time. I really appreciate it.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tI really, really do appreciate it. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome. As I said, I want that money donated to the San Francisco SafeHouse.\\nI:\\tYes. I have that noted.\\nR:\\tOkay. Good. Excellent.\\nI:\\tI will follow up about the letter.\\nR:\\tI appreciate it. It’d be helpful. I’m not asking for money, but I’m asking for a letter that says I was helpful that I participated in the survey. Because obviously, this helps the court diversion program, ultimately.\\nI:\\tI guess just in terms of structure, is it a “To whom this may concern: [Name] participated in this X, Y, and Z. He was helpful.” Done, and signed by the head researcher? Or is there someone more specific?\\nR:\\tDo something so you have the research ... “This information is used for,” blank, blank, blank. So they know that I participated in it, and also the purpose of it. That would be helpful. Because what’s going to happen is my attorney is going to go, “What have you done? What do we need to tell the court?” [Inaudible 58:37] number one, hopefully by the time I do this I’m sponsoring other people. I’m speaking on a regular basis at the first-time offenders program, speaking. Not participating, I’m just speaking. And then also participating in this survey. I’m continuing to work at program with recovery.\\nI:\\tI don’t foresee there being a problem with that, but if there is, is it okay if I call you back if we have any questions about that letter?\\nR:\\tYeah. Absolutely. Please do.\\nI:\\tIf you don’t hear from me, it’ll be in the mail. Yes.\\nR:\\tThanks so much. I appreciate it. Once again, the only thing is that if you block your number from me, I might not answer the call. You can easily get a Google Voice number or something.\\nI:\\tThat’s helpful.\\nR:\\tBecause I knew your name, and you don’t want people to know your name.\\nI:\\tThat’s good advice. Thank you.\\nR:\\tI’m in recovery. Some people you’re going to call are not in recovery.\\nI:\\tRight. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou might want to tell people, going forward, that might be … It’s a suggestion. Not just for you, but for other people. Anyway. My two cents.\\nI:\\tWait, sorry. Say that last part again. You might want to what?\\nR:\\tYou might want to let them know, other people, other people who are doing this as well. Like yourself. You’re in grad school, taking psychology for grad school, right?\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\tIt’s important you guys protect yourselves. That would be my feedback.\\nI:\\tThat’s really good. I will definitely make sure that other folks are taking that advice as well. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re quite welcome. You’re quite welcome. Anyway. Anything else for today?\\nI:\\tNo. I hope your presentation--your talk--at the program goes well tomorrow.\\nR:\\tThanks so much.\\nI:\\tThank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it. Have a good weekend.\\nR:\\tMy pleasure. You too. Take care.\\nI:\\tOkay. Thanks, Jeff.\\nR:\\tBye-bye.\\nI:\\tBye.\\n[End of SF657, part two.]\\nEND OF TRANSCRIPT\\n\\nSF657\\t\\tPage 1\\n\\n\\n'"

In fact, once I was gassing up in Santa Rosa, and this woman started yelling and screaming at me because she thought I overtook her for some reason, where she came in the wrong direction; I came in the right direction.

      "I:\tSo you didn't know, and then she contacted you later?\n",
      "R:\tNo, I found out, and I contacted her when she turned 21, because when I tried looking for her, the mother would not let me see her.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was that just because you didn't want you at all involved?\n",
      "R:\tShe didn't want me to know anything about what was going on. Back then, we didn't have gay rights amendment.\n",
      "I:\tAnd sort of off topic at this point, but what is your highest level of education?\n",
      "R:\tI have a grammar school diploma. But I have seven years of college. High school, four years of Jesuit prison, you know, but I gave them back the diploma. And [name] threatened me with a degree, but I didn't finish one basket-weaving course on purpose, because I don't have respect for the state of the academic system in the United States.\n",
      "I:\tCan you describe a little bit for me how that works?\n",
      "R:\tI'm very smart. I only go to the courses I want to go to. I only do the work that I want to. I learn for real. You know, I don't spit out test stuff; I learn. And, you know, most of the academics can't cope with that. For instance, I am a decorated computer technologist. I mean, I have multiple patents. I invented multimedia, okay? And I took one computer course. And because I did for the assignment something that I could use that was exactly what the assignment wasbut it wasn't exactly what he asked forhe failed me on the course. I was already at [name] working on the Unix operating system at the time. That probably doesn't mean anything to you, but it's ...\n",
      "I:\tI recognize the name.\n",
      "R:\tMe and Al Gore invented the internet. I connected to the internet in 1973. That was the first time I logged onto it. You know, I wrote some of the technical specifications for the internet.\n",
      "I:\tSo you didn't find what you wanted in the academic requirements, is what you're saying.\n",
      "R:\tIf I had a teacher that wanted to teach, I'd get along famously. I'd get an A. If I had a teacher that just wanted a regurgitating student, it wouldn't work. It wouldn't happen.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that happened mostly in your college years or\n",
      "R:\tThrough my whole lifetime. I gave my first lecture tour at the age of five on the planets, on Kepler's laws, and the state of the solar system, distribution of solar radiation across the planet causing seasonsfive years old. And then the nuns made me very popular by making me repeat my lecture in first through eighth grades.\n",
      "I:\tSo you went to a Catholic school at the time?\n",
      "R:\tA Catholic grammar school, yes, with nuns and \n",
      "I:\tFor how long?\n",
      "R:\tWell, they left me back. So it should have been nine years, and I was in there for ten. Yeah, they left me back in kindergarten, mostly because the kids kept on beating me up. I was small, not like today.\n",
      "I:\tSo was that all the way through high school?\n",
      "R:\tHigh school, I have not seen anybody from my high school since the day I left.\n",
      "I:\tSo grammar school, high school, and then some college.\n",
      "R:\tThe colleges are sevennot seven colleges; more like four or fivebut cherry-picking courses. I spent three years at [name] because they were paying me very well. And I was, at the same time, working for [name]. And in 1973, I was making over $20 an hour, which, back then, translates to about $160 today. So yeah, and that success has never stopped.\n",
      "I:\tSo again a little bit off topicdid you receive any help in school with academics, like tutoring or anything like that?\n",
      "R:\tI would tutor people.\n",
      "I:\tYou would tutor people, but you didn't receive any help yourself?\n",
      "R:\tDidn't need it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how do you support yourself financially?\n",

      "I:\tI'm going to say jobs, yeah.\n",
      "R:\tOkay.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how much do you earn?\n",
      "R:\tNorth of $300,000.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that's per year, I assume?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "OV:\tThat's not every year, dear.\n",

      "R:\tTrue. Oh, strongly agree.\n",
      "I:\t\"I want my family to be involved in my life.\"\n",
      "R:\tStrongly agree.\n",
      "I:\t\"I consider myself a source of support for my family.\"\n",

      "R:\tStrongly agree.\n",
      "I:\t\"I fight a lot with my family members.\"\n",
      "R:\tNot a lot. Put it at above one above smallest. You know, nobody has an ideal family, and we do have our squabbles, but they never last.\n",
      "I:\t\"I often feel like a disappointment to my family.\"\n",
      "R:\tNo. Strongly disagree.\n",
      "I:\t\"I am criticized a lot by my family.\"\n",
      "R:\tCriticized is different than joking around, so I strongly disagree with that, yeah. We're an Italian family. I don't know if you know what that means.\n",
      "I:\tI am familiar with the stereotype, yeah. \"I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.\"\n",
      "R:\tYeah, strongly agree.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how many people do you feel that way towards?\n",
      "R:\tWell, my immediate family. That's five. My wifethat's six. Okay, six.\n",
      "I:\t\"I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.\"\n",
      "R:\tTrue; I strongly agree.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how many do you feel that towards?\n",
      "R:\tHalf of themthree, four, yeah.\n",
      "I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.\" Not that you need it\n",
      "R:\tDon't need it.\n",
      "I:\tBut would they help you, should you come into a circumstance like that?\n",
      "R:\tThey'd have me move in with them.\n",
      "I:\tSo strongly agree?\n",
      "R:\tI wouldn't do it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how many people would offer you a place?\n",
      "R:\tI think every single one of them, yeah, if it came down to something like that, you know.\n",
      "I:\t\"I have someone in my life who would provide help or advice on finding a job,\" should you need it.\n",
      "R:\tYeah, put that one in the middle, okay? Because they don't travel in the spheres of the people that employ me, okay?\n",
      "I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or support with dealing with a health problem.\n",
      "R:\tStrongly agree.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how many would you say?\n",
      "R:\tAll of them.\n",
      "I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide transportation or some form of a ride to work or a ride to appointments.\"\n",
      "R:\tI've told you about the car already, didn't I? We use public transportation all the time. Then everybody else is on the other coast.\n",
      "I:\tNeutral?\n",
      "R:\tNeutral. Yeah, it's a nonapplicable question, really.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, because you use other forms of transportation.\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide me with financial support.\"\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely true.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how many do you feel that towards?\n",
      "R:\tI'd say all of them, if I ever needed anything. If I asked them for moneyif any of them asked me for money, they have money. If I ask any of them for money, I'll have money, you know. Money does not drive my family, even though it's a fairly wealthy family.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next couple questions are going to be open response. So family and friends can be sources of good, positive support, or they can be stressful and destructive influences. Can you give me an example of your family or your friends as being a positive influence on you?\n",
      "R:\tI'll give you an anecdote; how's that?\n",
      "I:\tOkay, perfect.\n",
      "R:\tA company I'm working for now is a global company. I'm doing a task that requires me to, you know, travel the whole world. And I went to London. I was assigned to, you know, go to London. And I picked up the phone, told my mom, hey, I'm headed for London. And she immediately said, when you're in London, go to the Museum of Art. I want to see pictures of this exhibit, this exhibit, and this exhibit. And she's going to be 89 years old on Saturday, okay? Didn't look up anything; it was all in her head, you know. So there's the anecdote for you.\n",
      "I:\tAnd can you give me an example of when your family or your friends were a bad influence or a destructive source for you?\n",
      "R:\tEvery single person in this complex is not a nice person and willfully destructive towards me. We're getting there.\n",
      "I:\tAnd for the purpose of the transcript, this is a condominium?\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you mentioned earlier that you have one child; you have a daughter.\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tHow would you describe your relationship with her now?\n",
      "R:\tMore than she wants, and less than I want. When you grow up your whole life, and your mom doesn't tell you anything about your dadexcept not nice thingsyou can't shake that. It's taken me quite a while to come to that accommodation, you know. I get to see my grandkid on Facebook, you know, three, four times a year. And that's got to be enough for me. I wanted to install aand she does call, and she does, you know, put the kid on Facebook. You know, we have a good conversation, you know. We don't argue. It's senseless to argue with your daughter. I wanted to put a Beam in her house. You know what a Beam is?\n",
      "I:\tYes.\n",
      "R:\tThey have household Beams now. So I wanted to put a Beam in the house so I could go visit. It took her less than a quarter of a second to say no, okay? As I said, you know, more than what she wants, but less than what I want. Yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd does she live near here, or\n",
      "R:\tShe lives in Jupiter, Florida.\n",
      "I:\tSo that's all the way across.\n",
      "R:\tOh, yeah, that's about as far as you could get fromthe only place you could be further away is Seattle.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how often do you see her, if she's living that far away?\n",
      "R:\tAlmost once a year, because we meet on neutral turf, mostly.\n",
      "I:\tWhat's neutral turf?\n",
      "R:\tMy mom has a condominium in Florida, besides the house inwell, I said Manhattan before; it's actually Bayonne, New Jersey, which is closer to Manhattan than most of the other boroughs. Yeah, we spend a holiday over at my mom's house.\n",
      "I:\tSo Thanksgiving or Christmas?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, or sometimes, you know, just sabbatical time. She's married to an academic.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how would you describe how much you're involved in her life?\n",
      "R:\tVery little.\n",
      "I:\tVery little?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next set of questions are about people outside your family. These are going to be the friends that you feel closest to. How many friends, up to three, do you feel closest to?\n",
      "R:\tUp to three?\n",
      "I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. And these are outside romantic or blood ties.\n",
      "R:\tRight, right. Oh, I don't knowwork included?\n",
      "I:\tSure.\n",
      "R:\tThree.\n",
      "I:\tAnd can you help me fill these out?\n",
      "R:\tLet me grab that for a minute, so I don't have to clip it off andpresbyopia. I'm sure you've heard of that.\n",
      "I:\tMm-hmm [yes].\n",
      "R:\tIt's really amazing. My far vision has gotten a lot better. For your third friendwe're starting with the third?\n",
      "I:\tYeah, it counts down, for some reason, on the\n",
      "R:\tWhat is the difference between Native American and Hispanic?\n",
      "I:\tNative American is American Indian, so that's like Cherokee or\n",
      "R:\tHow about South American? Are they Hispanic, or are they Native American? She's Venezuelan.\n",
      "I:\tI would say that's more Hispanic.\n",
      "R:\tShe doesn't, at all.\n",
      "I:\tIf she doesn't identify that way, you can ...\n",
      "R:\tI'll put Venezuelan, because that's what she identifies asif I could spell Venezuelan.\n",
      "I:\tI can do it if you want to.\n",
      "R:\tI'm not sure, but I thinkdid [name] ever graduate college, dear?\n",
      "OV:\tNo, I don't think so.\n",
      "R:\tOh, yeah, she is. She's working for pay. Yeah, she's a polyglot.\n",
      "OV:\tI know she went to college in Germany.\n",
      "R:\tShe did go to college in Germany and France. [Name], grab an iPad with her keyboard on it. The two guys are as white as white bread, really. Fifty-three, maybe? I'm guessing there. Oh no, no, I mixed up one and two here. That one's a college graduateand yes.\n",
      "OV:\tWell, I don't have [00:21:35 inaudible].\n",
      "R:\tGrab my iPad.\n",
      "OV:\tYour iPad?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, the big one. Are you a polyglot?\n",
      "I:\tTo be honest, I'm not familiar with the term.\n",
      "R:\tOh, it's somebody who speaks more than one language.\n",
      "I:\tOh, I wish. No. Never something I learned as a child.\n",
      "R:\tYeah, currently, she speaks five languages.\n",
      "I:\tYour Venezuelan friend?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tHow did you meet her?\n",
      "R:\tMutual friend brought her here. And she invented this.\n",
      "I:\tDo you want me to turn it towards you?\n",
      "R:\tThat's okay. I can operate it upside-down. Come on, go away. Go. Boy, theyremind me later. That's a keyboard that covers 36 different Latin-based languages.\n",
      "I:\tLatin-based languages?\n",
      "R:\tAll the European languages are in there. So you know, if you need the ...\n",
      "I:\tThat's wonderful.\n",
      "R:\tDone. There.\n",
      "I:\tI think social security counts for us, because that is money that comes from the government, not from ...\n",
      "R:\tIt's not public aid, though. He earned it. That's a big difference, you know.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, it is.\n",
      "R:\tIt's not public aid. I'm going to say no.\n",
      "I:\tOkay, that's fine.\n",
      "R:\tAnd they're both still alive, which is very happy for me.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next block of questions are on affiliations with groups or organizations.\n",
      "R:\tOh, this is going to be easy.\n",
      "I:\tAre you affiliated with any church or religious organization?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tRecreational club?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",

      "I:\tAny other group or affiliation?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\tThat was quick. So the next block of questions are going to be on employment. How old were you when you had your first job?\n",
      "R:\tNewspaper boy count?\n",
      "I:\tYeah.\n",
      "R:\tTen.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was that back in New Jersey or\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd at what point did you move to California?\n",
      "R:\tI moved here in 1977. So I guess I was 24, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tYou've been here for a while.\n",
      "R:\tOh yeah, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how much of your adult life have you been employedall, most, some, little?\n",
      "R:\tAll; self.\n",
      "I:\tSelf-employed for all of that?\n",
      "R:\tYes. I founded a company, but that's still self-employed.\n",
      "I:\tSo what skills do you feel like you bring to the labor market, and how did you learn them?\n",
      "R:\tSelf-learned computer genius. I say that with an absolute straight face. I don't work for an Apple Bar, really.\n",
      "I:\tSo at what point were you given access to computers?\n",
      "R:\tI built my first computer in 1959.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so you just continuously built and\n",
      "R:\tAnd then I built another computer that's a model of the one I built in 1963, sitting on the piano there, that red thing. It doesn't look like a computer, honest.\n",
      "I:\tNo, it doesn't.\n",
      "R:\tThat's a digital computer. That's my first digital computer. The first one I built was analog, when I was six years old. That one, I built when I was 10 years old. That was a digital one. It was a kit. And then the next one I got my hands on was when I was 14. My father bought a complex bookkeeping machine that was programmable. And he let me take it apart and program it at night.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did you ever get to do anything with the bookkeeping machine?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, I printed a Christmas tree. And I guess that was '68, '69, probablymaybe even '67yeah, '68, something like that.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was three anyone that helped you ...\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\t get any of these things?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tWere you able to afford the computer parts and everything, or did you go to a school and find those?\n",
      "R:\tI had my paper boy job, and then my second job was a cabana boy, which made a bit more than a paper boy. You know what a cabana boy is?\n",
      "I:\tYeah.\n",
      "R:\tAnd then my next job was working for my father when I was 14.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what did he do?\n",
      "R:\tMy father owned the third-largest oil company in New Jersey. And I was put on the trucks first with his master plumber; then with his master electrician; then with his master HVAC. And I learned all those skills.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long did you stay doing that?\n",
      "R:\tI worked for my dad until I was finished with collegewell, not finished with college; finished with my dad19.\n",
      "I:\tAnd then where did you go from there?\n",
      "R:\tI worked for three months for another HVAC company, and then [name] hired me.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long were you at [name]?\n",
      "R:\tAbout three or four years, something like that. And I was at [name] at the same time. I was the manager of HEL for [name].\n",
      "I:\tAnd describe that for me.\n",
      "R:\tHuman Experimental Laboratory.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how did you get into that position?\n",
      "R:\tI was studying art, and the psychology department had no place to put their HEL. And it was a computer-based system. And I was walking by, and I saw a computer with all sorts of graphic stuff on it. And I walked in, and now my number-one friend in that list was sitting there at a Selectric terminal, and he was writing APL. And I said, can we do our art on this computer? And he looks at me, you know. It's the first time we've ever set eyes on each other. And he goes, you want to do art? And I go, yeah, yeah, graphics, you know. He goes, can you program? I say, oh, I can definitely program. And he goes, okay, but you have to program for me. I said, fine.\n",
      "A year later, I was managing the laboratory, hired by [name]. I wrote the first tachistoscope program that ran from a computer. It's doing the Sternberg tasknowhat's the name of that task? The one where you measure the thinking time of the subject. You use a tachistoscope to do it.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, but I can't think of the name, either.\n",
      "R:\tYeah. So I wrote the first one. Then [name] heard about that. They hired me to do a tachistoscope for [name]. And then [name] heard about me, and they invited me to work on the Unix program. And then [name] heard about me, and he wanted me to work on the Music V program with him. I was the first person to make live computer music on a computer in 1972. And then [name] asked me to work on his digital synthesizer. I've done a lot of digital synthesizers, okay? But that's how it happens. I mean, you get a good break at the start. And my advertising technique was to have an unlisted phone number.\n",
      "I:\tAn unlisted phone numberwhat does that mean?\n",
      "R:\tOh, you guys don't remember phone books, do you?\n",
      "I:\tWell, we had phone books, but they were more used for kindling the fire and stuff.\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah. At one time, the phone book was what you used, okay?\n",
      "I:\tSo yours was not listed in the phone book.\n",
      "R:\tMy name was passed person to person, usually at the executive level of companies. I worked for [name], [name], [name]you know, all the biggies. And I've done a lot of life-critical programming.\n",
      "I:\tAnd are there any skills that you want to learn in the future at this point?\n",
      "R:\tThere's no end to computer science. I mean, I'm a researcher. And I was hired by this current company to do something nobody's ever done before. And, you know, I'll be finished in December for this project, and they turned around and saidand they took me out of retirement, basicallyand they said, can you give us another three years? Because they have more projects that are \"impossible to do.\" You know, that's been my whole mark. I've always done stuff with computers that nobody thought that they could do.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so they want you working until December, but ...\n",
      "R:\tOn this project. And then they said, do you have more years you could give us? Yeah, so that's a steady customer. Usually, steady customers hang out and bring me back. You know, one of the best things I heardI was invited to a meeting at one of my older customers, and they said, why don't we just pull the pin on [name] and throw him at it?\n",
      "I:\tSo have you experienced any barriers to employment, such as these?\n",
      "R:\tAs any of these?\n",
      "I:\tAnd you can choose more than one.\n",
      "R:\tI've always worked when I wanted to work. I always took a year off every decade, just to find out who I was.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you were mostly self-employed?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, essentially, I'm a purchase order.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how many jobs would you say you currently hold?\n",
      "R:\tRight now?\n",
      "I:\tYeah.\n",
      "R:\tWell, we just finished the keyboard. I consider that a job. It's a mentoring job for [name]. And, you know, the main thing is, you know, for my current client. And I very, very rarely do more than one major client at a timeonly when they insist, and both clients know that I'm splitting my time.\n",
      "I:\tSo two projects right now?\n",
      "R:\tActually, just one. We just finished the one. But I'm still her advisor. So you could count it as two.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what would you say your job title was?\n",
      "R:\tComputer Consultantvery simple.\n",
      "I:\tAnd when did you start as a computer consultant for yourself?\n",
      "R:\tAt [name].\n",
      "I:\tAnd what year was that?\n",
      "R:\tMust have been '73 or so, maybe '74.\n",
      "I:\tAnd would you consider it a full or a part-time job?\n",
      "R:\tIt's fulltime when I'm working, yeah. I mean, often, I wind up, you know, working with crews around the world. So yeah, it's all hours sometimes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how would you say you found this job? So how were you able ...\n",
      "R:\tI have a natural predilection to making computers do exactly what I want them to do. If you want to hear the mystic version of it ...\n",
      "I:\tSay whatever you'd like.\n",
      "R:\tI make computer random enough to work the way we want it to.\n",
      "I:\tAnd is that typical of the jobs that you've had in the past?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. Well, except for working for my dad, you know. But that was summer work. That wasn't fulltime work. That was, you know, a kid working for his dad, you know.\n",
      "I:\tThe majority of your life, though, you've been working computers and ...\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd in general ...\n",
      "R:\tWas never a fry cook.\n",
      "I:\tIn general, how would you describe your experiences in the job market so far?\n",
      "R:\tI've had a blessed career. And don't take that in the religious sense. You know, I've had a lucky career, but it's not luck. I've been rewarded for my hard work very well.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what is your typical environment for work?\n",
      "R:\tThat room over theredid you see it?\n",
      "I:\tSo you've been working ...\n",
      "R:\tI mostly work at home. If I work at the company, I generally get used as a resource by the other people, and it doesn't get my job done.\n",
      "I:\tAnd earning-wise, have you been making ...\n",
      "R:\tI've been making plus money for my whole life, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd could you tell me about your most positive work experience?\n",
      "R:\tOh, there's so many of them. Let me put it this way, okay? Did you see the film \"The Imitation Game\"?\n",
      "I:\tYes.\n",
      "R:\tYou know when they're all gathered around the computer, and it works for the first time?\n",
      "I:\tMm-hmm [yes].\n",
      "R:\tI've been in that situation at least six times in my life.\n",
      "I:\tWith new projects?\n",
      "R:\tWith something that works for the first time that changes the world. I've been thereit's more than anybody ever deserves. I mean, all those people at [name], you know, that was their only experience like that. I've had that experience more times than it's really fair for one person to have.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how would you describe that feeling?\n",
      "R:\tIt gives a moment to see the future. You know, one of them was a catheter that snaked inside of the heart, that let them actually do work on the heart without cracking the ribcage. And, you know, for a flashand it's imagination, but for a flash, you see how many people's lives you've saved. You know, you couldn't crack their cage; they'd be dead before you could close.\n",
      "Or the space shuttlesuddenly, the astronaut doesn't have to look down at the instruments; he's looking out the window, and his entire display cluster is there. I mean, it's an amazing feeling.\n",
      "I:\tSo on the opposite end, how would you describe your most negative experience?\n",
      "R:\tWorking with the Chinese. Definitely working with the Chinese.\n",
      "I:\tWhat is it about that that made it negative?\n",
      "R:\tTheir techniques of computer programming are hit and miss. There is no computer science about them. It is strictly, you know, keep on shoving things into the holes, and see if they work. In fact, one of my clientswhich one was it? It was [name]. Strike that.\n",
      "I:\tNo, it's okay. Then all names and companies will be ...\n",
      "R:\tI'm trying not to use names, okay? One of the companiesI told them immediately they were making a mistake by switching a part of the development overseas. And let's put it this way: In the court hearings that happened three years later, the attorney on my client's side said, were you enjoying your work? And I said, no. It turned into a whole nightmare. He goes, was there anybody telling you not to work there anymore? And I looked at him, and I said, you mean besides my wife? And even the opposition broke up on that one. I mean, you know, I think about three days later, they settled.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you emphasized the word science. What do you mean? What does computer science mean to you?\n",
      "R:\tComputer science means that you map out all of the things that the program's going to do, how it's going to do it, and especiallydo you ever play chess?\n",
      "I:\tI did, yeah.\n",
      "R:\tSo you played fairly seriously? You know what MCO is?\n",
      "I:\tI do not, no.\n",
      "R:\tHave you ever played againstthis is something I did in high school, you know. I was on the chess team. But have you ever seen somebody play multiple boards?\n",
      "I:\tYes.\n",
      "R:\tThat is how computers are done. They don't look at, you know, the whole sequence of the game; they look at the position. And a computer doing a program is a series of positions. You have to map those out very carefully, and in detail, and not have any of your pawns drop off the board. And that's computer science. Right now, I'm so disgusted with the state of thethere is no state of the art anymore. I mean, it's keep on hacking the code until it doesn't break as much, you knowwhereas, you know, I'm used to doing code that, if it does break, somebody dies.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you're talking about technological world today as being just hacking and\n",
      "R:\tYeah, because, you know, what is it? One thing that's hiring most programmers right nowwebsites. And who cares if the website breaks? Doesn't matter. Well, there are websites where somebody might die. And even those aren't, I think, sufficiently computer scienced. But that's my opinion.\n",
      "I:\tIs there anything more you'd like to add to that subject?\n",
      "R:\tRepeat the question again, from the top?\n",
      "I:\tIs there anything more you'd like to add to that subject?\n",
      "R:\tNo, not that ...\n",
      "I:\tYour employment experiences.\n",
      "R:\tOh, the bad employment experiencesyeah, okay, no. We're fine with that. Yeah, I think I gave you a good overall view.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next couple questions are on substance abuse. Have you ever had a drinking and/or drug problem?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tWere they ever a minor part of your life?\n",
      "R:\tI drink half a bottle of wine a day. I split a bottle of wine with my wife. And occasionally, I'll drink a whole bottle.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next couple questions are going to be on mental and emotional health issues. Have you ever been told by a mental health professional, a doctor, psychiatric nurse that you had a mental or emotional condition?\n",
      "R:\tJust recently.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what did they say?\n",
      "R:\tThey said I was autistic. I had no idea.\n",
      "I:\t[43:44 crosstalk].\n",
      "R:\tWell, next dooroh gosh, another one of my best friends, but I don't see him enough anymorehe's 89. And he's a world-famous surgeon. He was a Dean at UC, a Dean at UC Davis, at SF. He's a consultant for emergency medicine throughout the entire country. He set up the first trauma center here at SF General. And, you know, he just looked at me and said, you know you're autistic. And I said, you're crazy. [Name], my wife, has a very severe autistic brotheryou know, work-enabled. But she didn't think so, either. But then I have a very old, good friend who is a professor of psychology. And I Skyped him up. I said, do you think I'm autistic? Didn't even blink. Of course you are.\n",
      "So that's the existentialsee, I'm so proud of my brain that, you know, I think it's one of the best in the world, but now I know it's broken.\n",
      "I:\tWould you consider autism as broken?\n",
      "R:\tOh yeah, that's broken. And so many of my past experiences now make so much sense, where people are telling me, don't you see? And, you know, I'm going, what are you talking about? You know, you're crazy. You know, you're just, you know, trying to mix me up. And so I'm sort of in a very introspective moment in my life. You know, to find out at 63 you're autistic when you think you had a perfectly functioning human brainlife's always interesting.\n",
      "I:\tWere those experiences where you're like, oh, maybe I am autistic ...\n",
      "R:\tNo, I mean, I was absolutely sure everybody was wrong. And now, you know, two people I really trustnow I have to come to grips with it, and understand it, and make adjustments.\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you feel like it played a big part in your past goal, even if you didn't know about it?\n",
      "R:\tOh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's one of the reasons why I've been beaten up a lot.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like explaining a little bit about that, or\n",
      "R:\tLuckily, in a Jesuit high school, you can't beat up each other. If I went to a normal high school, I would have been the kid shoved in the locker and everything all the time, okay? In grammar school, the nuns didn't have that much of a handle, so, you know, I would be regularly dragged out of the schoolyard and tromped on by both boys and girls in groups, okay? And then, you know, it makes sense now where I'm seeing where people I trusted that I shouldn't have trusted ...\n",
      "I:\tThroughout your life?\n",
      "R:\tThroughout my lifethat's why they walked away with all my money.\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you have an example to [47:26 inaudible]?\n",
      "R:\tWell, I wrote a program called Keynote, which [name]I know those guys from day one, the [name]s, okay? But the guy that said he was going to market it and make so much money did market it and make so much money, but he had me paying for all the advertising at the same time, because I always have a major client. And I wrote the Keynote program practically overnight. And it became extremely popular on the IBM PCs, the first ones. And he pocketed all the money on me. He said it wasn't selling.\n",
      "And then I'm then to multimedia. I already said that. And that's what I formed a little company for. And the patent, which is only in my namethe first multimedia patentwas moved to Canada by [name]. And you could leave that name in, okay? [Name]he's the M in [name]. [Name] was one of the original film companies. And he moved the patent to Canada, so I couldn't get an attorney to get my patent rights back. The patent made over $35 million, and I didn't get a penny, because I trust the wrong people, because I can't see what a normal human being sees.\n",
      "I:\tIn trustworthy people?\n",
      "R:\tIn, you know, communicating with people. So yeah, it's had an effect my whole life. I landed on my feet.\n",
      "I:\tSo coming back to mental and emotional issues, have you ever felt that you had an issue that wasn't diagnosed, that someone didn't say anything about?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tHave you ever thought you had a learning disability or a processing issue?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, what I'm now coming to terms with.\n",
      "I:\tHave you ever taken medication prescribed by a doctor for a mental or emotional issue?\n",
      "R:\tI was supposedly being treated for acne, which you can't see because I keep myself covered up. I also had something in the neighborhood of 40 facial surgeries to close a lot of those scars. But my mother had arranged for the physician to give me Ritalin instead ofand they were hoping that would, you know, make [name] more normal.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long did you have to take that?\n",
      "R:\tI think it was a month or two, and I said, I really have to stop. Supposedly, it was for my acne. He was, you know, injecting it. And actually, my mom even said, you know, we're going to stop this; your acne isn't getting better.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how old were you at the time?\n",
      "R:\tOh, I must've been about 18, 17, in there.\n",
      "I:\tAnd have you ever been admitted to a mental hospital?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tAnd have you ever received counseling or therapy for a mental or emotional issue?\n",
      "R:\tI tried once, when my father was on his deathbed.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how so?\n",
      "R:\tI went to Kaiser and said, you know, maybe I should talk to, you know, a psychologist. And that didn't work out at all.\n",
      "I:\tNo?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tBecause you didn't get along with\n",
      "R:\tWell, I asked her not to record some stuff, and she did in her notes. And so, you know, when she read her notes back at me on my second session, I just walked out; didn't say a word to her. Just walked out.\n",
      "I:\tBecause you didn't want her to take note of\n",
      "R:\tOf some things, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tSo that was not a helpful experience for you.\n",
      "R:\tNo, not at all.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like you have an emotional or mental issue now, aside from the recently-termed autism that you were talking about?\n",
      "R:\tNo. You know, I'm pretty pissed off, but that's not an emotional issue. I think I'm justifiably pissed off.\n",
      "I:\tAnd are you talking about your pretrial diversion situation?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd we'll get to that in a second.\n",
      "R:\tI figured.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how would you say your emotional or mental concerns have changed over the years?\n",
      "R:\tPretty much, I'm happy with me. I mean, I play piano. I compose. I do great work. Yeah. Most people, you know, would like a piece of what I have.\n",
      "I:\tIs there anything more you'd like to add to that topic?\n",
      "R:\tNo, that's fine.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next block is around arrests, and convictions, and those things. Approximately how many times have you been arrested in your lifetime?\n",
      "R:\tOnce.\n",
      "I:\tAnd for what charge was that for?\n",
      "R:\tArrested. I was arrested for two felony arsons, the bail of which was set for $400,000 apiece.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how old were you at this time?\n",
      "R:\t[name], do you remember age?\n",
      "OV:\tSixty?\n",
      "R:\tWas I 60 even?\n",
      "OV:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd could you describe for me the events of your arrest? So that day, leading up to it, and\n",
      "R:\tLet's start with leading up to it. Okay, [name] was just convicted. I mean, a person who I think is one of the greatest American patriots of this millennia, okay? And arrested, convicted. I got really pissed and a little drunk, and there's a veteran downstairs. He had American flags in his plant pod outside his house, and I burned one of thema toy flag. And a week later, the police bang on the door, drag me outwell, no, they didn't drag me outside. They wanted to come inside, but I had a very bad feeling, because there were three of them, okay? It's the first time I'm in trouble with the police, but I feel it's not like any other situation I had with the police, okay?\n",
      "You know, up until then, I was a concerned citizen. If something happened, I'd call the police. If something was going on outside, and I observed it, I'd go down and talk to the police on the scene, and give them witness. You know, to me, it was a civic responsibility. And then the police bang on my door, and don't give me time to change or anything. And there was one woman cop that said, you know, they saw you burn the flag. And I said, yeah, I burned a toy flag, you know. I was pissed at the government, you know. You know, when I was in high school, I used to burn an American flag a week in Washington Square Park. I mean, you know, the Vietnam War protest, you knowthis is what you do to show your disfavor with the government and what the government's doing.\n",
      "And the guy downstairs was forcedbecause he was the accuserbut it goes really deeper than this. The guy downstairs, they say, you don't want him arrested for this, do you? And he said, no. Finally, he said, noyou know, this vindictive thug Iraqi war veteran, tiny, itty-bitty brain, okay? Spoke proudly of killing people. I mean, yeah, proudly, like it's an accomplishment to kill someone, okay? So needless to say, we weren't on best of terms. But when I burned the flag, I fell into a trap in the fire department.\n",
      "I:\tHow so?\n",
      "R:\tCivic-minded, remember? When the alarm system started breaking in this place, a fire inspector from the fire department was called in to declare what had to be done. And this fire inspector decided that we had to upgrade our entire system towhat year was it? It was 1990-something, late '90s. No, wait a minute. It was 63 years agoso it was to the 2010 standards. And she said, well, because the company that made your equipment doesn't exist anymore, and you can't replace in kind. I'm an engineer, okay? And I said, well, this sounds like total bullshit, because I know when you make a fire alarm, the parts have got to be available for 50 years.\n",
      "So I went digging, and I found, at the bottom ofI think it was Honeywell or somethingI found the large company that bought the small company that still had to make the devices for the fire alarm system, and I turned a $16-million project that, obviously to me, the fire inspector was getting a piece of, along with Cityscapebecause they get a piece of everythingthe management company for the three buildingsand I called her up, and I said, hey, I found the parts; it's great. She never answered. Went up the chain. I called her boss, her captain. And he happened to be from the next town over in New Jersey, and we got along famously. And I said, all I'm trying to do is save us some money. And he goes, yeah, okay. That makes perfect sense. I'll talk to her.\n",
      "Well, she got fired. So the fire department had it in for me. And even though the guy downstairs dropped charge, and the police left, the police came back when the fire department came down on the police, and said, you have to arrest him.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did you ever find proof that they instigated that, or is this a hunch that you had?\n",
      "R:\tIt's all over the paperwork, you know, because I had to hire a lawyer, and I got all the paperwork. It's all over the paperwork. So mind you, for burning a toy flag, they threw me in solitary for three days from that point on. But before solitary, they wouldn't take me into the prison, because I have hypertensionvery well under control, except at times of great stress.\n",
      "First of all, another thing that got me really pissed off is, when they took me away, they said, you'll be back in an hour. And it was a bold-face lie. I didn't have any idea that the police could look you in the eye and tell you a lie. I mean, I thought the police had to tell the truth when they were arresting you. They didn't even tell me the charge. They didn't even read me my Miranda rightswhich, actually, I think they did that on purpose.\n",
      "I:\tAnd why do you think that?\n",
      "R:\tBecause they didn't want to arrest me. Well, the woman didn't want to arrest me. The two guys wanted to arrest me. I burned a flag. But the lady cop was sort of, you know, this is a personal thing going on here. And it was the fire department that really pissed her off, and then she didn't read the MirandaI'm sure that's why she didn't read the Mirandas, because, you know, that's a rookie mistake, you know.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was that something you were able to use later on in the process?\n",
      "R:\tOh yeah. I'll finish the whole story.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, continue, please.\n",
      "R:\tSo they put me in holding here at Richmond. I thought the next thing was going to happen. I was going to go home. They came in. They then took me towhat is it calledthe building of non-justice.\n",
      "I:\tThe CJCis that it?\n",
      "R:\tIs that it? Where the jail is.\n",
      "I:\tOkay, so that's 850 Bryant.\n",
      "R:\tYeah, they took me there. And they tried to push me right into the jail. They took my blood pressure. And I was already not feeling well. I was not feeling well at all. When I was in the holding cell, the walls were melting, okay? And I knew that the ringing in my ears meant that my blood pressure was at a lifetime high. And they wouldn't put me in the jail; they sent me to San Francisco General, in order to get my blood pressure down.\n",
      "At San Francisco General, I spent, you know, a good number of hours there. They wanted to give me psychoactives to calm me down, but I never demonstrated any, you know, aggressive behavior or anything like that; I was just sick. And I'm pretty sure at that point, I had a stroke, a small strokesomething that, you know, debilitated me quite a bit. So they take me. They gave me, you know, my normal stuffverapamil and lisinopril, and I think they gave me some HCT. And they got it down, you know, at least where I wasn't going to stroke out any moment. And they took me back to the jail. They put me into solitary for three days.\n",
      "I:\tAnd this was at 850 Bryant?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. Three days of general, then they put me in the general population for another two days. And then in that time, two policeare there police inspectors in San Francisco or detectives?\n",
      "I:\tDetectives.\n",
      "R:\tSo two lady detectives come to the jail, read me my Miranda rights, ask me a few questions. I say, I don't have a lawyer; I can't talk to you. I really can't. And they say, thoroughly understand. And that night, one of the guards passed by and says, you're out. And the next day, they released me, and instead of having an $800,000 two felony account against me, they reduced it towhat's the least kind of vandalism?\n",
      "I:\tIt's just a misdemeanor, like [01:05:22 inaudible].\n",
      "R:\tYeah, I mean nothing, you know.\n",
      "I:\tSo were you given access to a counsel at any time, or did you not want a counsel?\n",
      "R:\tI kept onmy wife went crazy. I mean, we were trying to find counsel. One loser showed up that wasyou know, he was sweating profuselylawyer. Then a public defender came, and I asked for release on my own recognizance. I mean, because this is, you know, just total ridiculous. And finally, without counsel, they lowered the charge from double felony to, you know, minor misdemeanor.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you found that out at the point of your release?\n",
      "R:\tAt the moment of my release from the jail. That's when I found out. I didn't find out that I was charged with two felonies until I was inside the solitary.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long afterfrom arrest to finding that outhow much time passed?\n",
      "R:\tThe felony?\n",
      "I:\tFinding out that you had two felonies.\n",
      "R:\tIt was the next day in jail, in solitary. Oh, wait a minute. No, they didn't give me the paperwork until they released me in the general population. That's when I found out I had two felonies.\n",
      "I:\tSo you had three days in solitary where you had no idea.\n",
      "OV:\tI hate to interrupt, but that's not correct, because I called for a bail bondsman, and then they told me that it was $800,000two $400,000 felony convictions.\n",
      "R:\tBut I did not know that.\n",
      "OV:\tYes, I told you that, because we were talking to each other every couple of hours on the phone. You don't remember.\n",
      "R:\tI don't, because\n",
      "OV:\tYeah, I know. It's traumatic. I understand.\n",
      "R:\tIt was the most horrific experience of my life. It made me lose faith in everything in the United States and community. I mean, I worked for the people in this place when the internet went down in the '90s. I created a small company just to provide the people in these three buildings with internet. And I only charged them $30 each. I mean, I did the thing with the fire alarm where we were going to get a $24-million charge, and I turned it down to a $6-million charge. And then these people viciously turn on me. And it wasn't only the guy downstairs. I burnt an American flag. They're all suddenly all flag-waving hallucinogenics, you know.\n",
      "I:\tAre you talking about your other neighbors?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. I mean, you know, people we were inside their houses anytime they needed their computers fixed for free, for that $30 a month, we went into their houses. We fixed their computers for free, for the $30 a month for the charge, you know. And you couldn't get internet out here, you know. I told you, you know, I've been on the internet since the '70s, and they knew it, and they had me do it for them. For 10 years, we ran a perfect business. And then we get home. I am severely suffering from PTSD. My brain's not working. As I said, I think I had a stroke. I asked for checkups at Kaiser. Kaiser wasn't interested in, you know, going completely over me.\n",
      "I:\tThis is post getting out that you're talking about?\n",
      "R:\tPost getting out. And yeah, it's devastating. It was just totally devastating that, you know, the police department, the fire department, the people in the complexhow they turned on a dime.\n",
      "I:\tDo you still feel that way now?\n",
      "R:\tOh, absolutely.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like this is a safe place for you to live?\n",
      "R:\tSafe, yes.\n",
      "I:\tBut you feel antagonism from\n",
      "R:\tI feel anger towards them. And one thing I've learned is, you don't give people a second chance.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that's from your past experiences?\n",
      "R:\tThat's from all of my business experiences. Yeah, and the few people that really wanted a second chance that I gave a second chance to, and they just did the same thing all over again.\n",
      "I:\tSo going back to the time of the arrestat that point, did you feel like the police were treating you fairly?\n",
      "R:\tNo. They lied.\n",
      "I:\tSo they told you that you were going to be detained for an hour?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd\n",
      "R:\tIt turned into five days, three of which were in solitary confinement.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so, for my clarification, they came to your home.\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tThey asked you, and then they left, and then they came back again.\n",
      "R:\tYep.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how much time passed in between those two\n",
      "R:\tLess than an hour.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so they took you from your home to a police station.\n",
      "R:\tMm-hmm [yes]the Richmond police station.\n",
      "I:\tThen they took you to 850 Bryant.\n",
      "R:\tAnd 850 Bryant would not let me in because of my blood pressure.\n",
      "I:\tAnd then you went to SF General.\n",
      "R:\tAnd then back to Bryant.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long did you spend at SF General?\n",
      "R:\tAt least five hours.\n",
      "I:\tGeneralizations work. Have you ever been convicted of a crime?\n",
      "R:\tNo. Then we hired this do-nothing lawyer for $5,000. She showed up once. And she didn't even show up when I had fulfilled the requirements for the diversion program. She didn't even show up. She just let the judge decide that he did it.\n",
      "I:\tThe private attorney?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. I never did like lawyers. You could guess why.\n",
      "I:\tSo have you ever spent time in juvenile detention?\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\tHow about a prison?\n",
      "R:\tThat was it. I don't think that's prison, though. You call that one jail. Right. I learned the difference between those through this experience. I thought they were all jail and prison and interchangeable, you know.\n",
      "I:\tHave you ever spent time on parole or probation?\n",
      "R:\tNo, they didn't give me any parole.\n",
      "I:\tAnd it was just the one time that you spent in the jail, and that was about five days?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. I got to say, I mean, when they put me in the general population, I think they cherry-picked. You know, they put me with, you know, nice guys. I mean, you know, yeah, nobody ever threatened me or anything like that.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you in a cell block, or one just giant cell?\n",
      "R:\tWhat's the difference?\n",
      "I:\tA cell block is, you have individual cells along the side, and you have a clear space in the middle.\n",
      "R:\tThis was a weird one. They have this one cell right next tothe cell block car door. You have these on both sides. But then you go all the way to the end, to the pigpen. And next to the pigpen, there's a room maybe twice the size of this room, with, I'd say, roughly 20 beds in it.\n",
      "I:\tSo kind of like a hostel, in the way that the beds are set up on the wall.\n",
      "R:\tThey're bunk bedsmaybe 10 different bunk bedsand a shower, and a toilet. I learned how to shit and press the button immediately.\n",
      "I:\tSo you were staying in the cell next to what you termed the pigpen?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the pigpen is, for my\n",
      "R:\tWhere the guards live. And they had direct view into the cell at all times. So I don't know if that was good or bad. I have no experience. I know nobody hassled me. And in fact, you know, there were a couple that actually were very supportive to me. And I think it's because the first time I took a shower, you have that paper that you're supposed to carry around with you, with your charges and everything, and I think they're all very impressed that my bail was $800,000.\n",
      "I:\tSo that was a reputation ...\n",
      "R:\tI think that gave meand I'm an old, fat guy, you know. I think it took me up a couple of ranks. That's complete supposition on my part, because they were kind of surly before I took my first shower. You know, I didn't take the paperwork into the shower, but I left it under my pillow. But suddenly, I got out of the shower, and they're all, oh mano.\n",
      "I:\tSo can you describe these people that were supporting you?\n",
      "R:\tMostly Hispanics. Mostly, you know, immigrants. Yeah, obviously, you know, some of them did some things wrong, but, you know, nothing on the order of, you knowif we were in Norway, or if we were in any civilized country, they wouldn't have been in jail.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you would characterize America as uncivilized?\n",
      "R:\tOh, extremely. Did you read the article today in the paper? I mean, a traffic warrant, and they blow her away inside of her own house, and wing her kid.\n",
      "I:\tWhat happened?\n",
      "R:\tOh, you didn't hear this one?\n",
      "I:\tNo, no.\n",
      "R:\tAnd you know what the article was about? It's unfair that people take pictures of the police killing them. She was posting videos of the police, you knowI mean, SWAT teaming her house over a parking ticket or maybe a traffic violation that she hadn't paid. And they didn't break in. The landlord gave them the key, and they came in, and she had a shotgun. And she was telling them, keep out, keep out, keep out. What kind of country allows the police to escalate a traffic ticket to that degree? No, this is not a civilized country. We have a death penalty. I mean, who has death penalties? Saudi Arabia? India and Pakistan, it's a death penalty to be a girl. But we have that now. I mean, you know, they're suggesting that women who have abortions should be punished. I mean, you think this place is civilized? Yeah, no, it's not a civilized place.\n",
      "I:\tSo the next couple of statements are the strongly agree to strongly disagree again. And they're going to be about legal authorities. \"I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.\"\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely not.\n",
      "I:\t\"People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.\"\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely not.\n",
      "I:\t\"It is difficult to break the law and keep one's self-respect.\"\n",
      "R:\tI think you're keeping your self-respect by breaking the law.\n",
      "I:\t\"The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the people like me.\"\n",
      "R:\tThat's absolutely true.\n",
      "I:\t\"People in power use the law to try to control people like me.\"\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\t\"The law does not protect my interests.\"\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely not. You know, and it's not only this thing that happened to me; it hasn't protected my interests at all in my whole career. I mean, you know, that's why I went strictly instead of making deals where I get pieces of the action of my product, I make deals where I just get paid by the hour, because ...\n",
      "I:\tAnd are you referencing situations like the patent moving to Canada?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, and stuff like that, yeah. They'll have a thousand different ways of screwing you over.\n",
      "I:\t\"Most police in my city do their job well.\"\n",
      "R:\tNo.\n",
      "I:\t\"Most police in my city treat people with respect.\"\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely not.\n",
      "I:\t\"Basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police.\"\n",
      "R:\tNot at all.\n",
      "I:\t\"The police in my city have too much power.\"\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely true.\n",
      "I:\t\"Most police in my city treat some people better than others.\"\n",
      "R:\tYeah, they always treat Mayor Whatshisname really nice.\n",
      "I:\tThe Mayor of ...\n",
      "R:\tOf San Francisco. Yeah, I think he gets treated really well.\n",
      "I:\tBy\n",
      "R:\tPolice.\n",
      "I:\tI can't think of an example for that.\n",
      "R:\tMe either, but that's okay. I mean, you get the idea. Oh, yeah, I know who they treat very well.\n",
      "I:\tWho?\n",
      "R:\t[name] and [name].\n",
      "I:\tWhy do you say that?\n",
      "R:\tBecause they own the town.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you're referencing San Francisco.\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tSo have you ever felt unfairly treated, stopped, questioned, or searched by the police?\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how many times in your lifetime would you say this has happened?\n",
      "R:\tOnce in Palo Alto over a traffic ticket. I was pulled over because I forgot a traffic ticket. And I was strip-searched on that for a traffic ticket in Palo Alto. But Palo Alto's famous for that back then, okay? This was way back. Up until thenand then in San Francisco, you know, we had this incident, and then I stopped at a stop sign, and I went, and [name] decided to pull me over, and tell me I ran the stop sign. And I didn't. I just plain didn't. But his quota's whatever. I was in the park. There's no way I can not know where all the stop signs are in the park. And yeah, I called up, and I said, this is wrong. I have to fight this. I spoke to either a lieutenant or a captain. And he says, forget it, you know. Just take the course, because even if you contest it, he won't show up. This guy's known to do this kind of stuff. So he just won't show up, so you can contest the ticket. He said, you'd be wasting your time.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were there other circumstances ...\n",
      "R:\tNo, that's it. I'm very clean-nosed. You know, when I get a speeding ticket, which hasn't been in a very longthe last time I got a speeding ticket was in Santa Rosa, and I deserved a speeding ticket. It was a CHP, and I was on a back road, trying to get around the traffic on 101. And, yeah, I really was going 60 miles an hour in a 50-mile-an-hour zone, no question about it. Yeah, he's an asshole, but, you know\n",
      "I:\tBut it was a fair stop?\n",
      "R:\tI didn't say fair; I said it was legal. He wasn't lying, okay?\n",
      "I:\tAnd what defines fair for you?\n",
      "R:\tOkay, I'll tell you one good incident with the police that was fair. Have you ever been to the Maytag Festival here?\n",
      "I:\tI have not.\n",
      "R:\tOh, it's really gorgeous. They're really good neighbors. They don't shut off the whole park. And they have a free music festival here.\n",
      "OV:\t[01:23:00 inaudible].\n",
      "R:\tHardly Strictly Bluegrass, it's called, but they have a lot more than just bluegrass music. And I looked around. There are two cops on the picnic table next to me, and they start laughing. So yeah, I was treated fairly. I got to be honest. Yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd when was the last time you felt unfairly treated? This circumstance?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. Now, you know, if I see anybody in authority, I cross the street. I don't make eye contact. I do everything I can to avoid them.\n",
      "I:\tAnd is that because of the last experience that you've had?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, mm-hmm.\n",
      "I:\tAnd to what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experiences with police?\n",
      "R:\tOh, my personal race, not at all. But I've seen them take down black people and brown people. I mean, I've seen them disrespect people, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tDo you see that often here?\n",
      "R:\tI see it on the TV, okay? I got to say that, you know. Maybe I've witnessed one arrest of another person in my whole life, but I can't even be sure about that, you know. What I do is, I read about it, and I see it. And I don't watch the videos. What I do is, I read about the videos.\n",
      "I:\tFrom news sources?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, usually the newspaper. Should we turn on that light?\n",
      "I:\tYeah, sure. So going back to the five days at 850 Bryant, could you tell me about the typical day in solitary?\n",
      "R:\tMeal gets pushed through the door. I was let out once to have a shower. I asked for a book, and they laughed at me. And essentially, I just judged the jailers as vicious, mean people.\n",
      "I:\tJailers are law enforcement? Is that what you're talking about?\n",
      "R:\tWell, law enforcement's different than the guys that live in the jail, aren't theythe guards in the jail, right? The lock keys, whatever you call them.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you felt they were\n",
      "R:\tVicious.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what was a typical day like when you were outside of that, when you were in that cell next to the pen?\n",
      "R:\tOnce I got my status bars, you know, the inmates were all very nice. And the guards were still complete, utter assholes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was there a specific instance where they were\n",
      "R:\tYou know, they don't talk to you. I mean, there should be at least, you know, some sort of briefing that, you know, this is what's going to happen to you, you know, some sort of briefing. And, you know, I mean, I was told I was going to be let go, but only at 2:00 in the morning. And they just sort of whispered it as if he wasn't really talking to me. That was vicious. That was mean.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that was the very last day?\n",
      "R:\tThat was the last night, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd at 2:00 am, this guy walked by and whispered, you're getting released?\n",
      "R:\tYou're getting out, is what he said.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long after he said that did you actually get out?\n",
      "R:\t7:00 pm the next day. No, it was more like 9:00 pm the next day, yeah. And no other information besides that; just, they showed up in the cell. They showed up outside our cell, rattled off, you know, some names, chained us all together, put us down the elevator, and then had us just wait. Didn't let us use phones or anything. You know, I couldn't call home and say, I'm on my way home. I couldn't get a taxi, because the taxis downtown won't stop for a guy in shorts inappropriately at night. So I had to take buses. The bus broke down. I mean, you know, it was ...\n",
      "I:\tHow long did it take you to get home?\n",
      "R:\tAt least two, three hours.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what was the biggest challenge while you were inside?\n",
      "R:\tKeeping my hope.\n",
      "I:\tThat you were going to get released?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, because I knew the charge was total bullshit. I mean, this is the kind of thing that, you know, somebody burns down an apartment building, and 12 people die. That's the kind of charge they hit me withand two of them, as if I burnt down two apartment buildings.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you said that you and your wife were able to have phone conversations during that time?\n",
      "R:\tOnce I got into the general population, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tSo while you were in solitary, you had no phone?\n",
      "R:\tI think I got one call a day.\n",
      "OV:\tYes, you did, dear.\n",
      "R:\tI got one call a day.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you able to access counsel in solitary?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. As I said, the public defender came, and the sweaty lawyer to be interviewed. I wouldn't let him near my case.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that was a private attorney, though?\n",
      "R:\tThat was a private attorney.\n",
      "I:\tThe sweaty guy?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd then you picked up another private attorney\n",
      "R:\tOnce I was out. And she turned out to be, yeah, only in it for the money. It's pretty obvious. I mean, you know, because the association called me downstairs to try me again. And they didn't even ask me what the charges were or anything. You know, I didn't even know what the charges were. And they changed the rules especially for me, so that the first $150 fine was boosted to $2,000. The HOA fined me $2,000. But, you know, these were all the people that were my best friends that, you know, I gave internet to for 10 years and everything. They railroaded me.\n",
      "I:\tHOA is the housing association [01:30:46 crosstalk]?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd while you were at 850 Bryant, were there any informal rules or unwritten behaviors that you had to adhere to?\n",
      "R:\tOh, there was one that I didn't know. The first thing I do, I get up in the morning; I take a shower. And that was a bad thing to do. You know, they just said, don't do that again.\n",
      "I:\tSo you're not allowed to take showers in the morning?\n",
      "R:\tBecause of the inspections of the cells. There's one guy that was an absolute cleaning fanatic. And he would clean everything up. And I didn't realize that, you know, I shouldn't get up in the morning and take a shower. I had to wait until everybody told me to take a shower. In fact, that is what, you know, pretty much saved me at that pointwhen I realized, you know, I don't do anything without their permission.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you're talking about your fellow cellmates at that point?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah, the cellmates, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did you have any responsibilities or obligations on the outside that you were not able to fulfill?\n",
      "R:\tNo, I squeaked by on that. I can't remember if I was between jobs or if I was doing a job.\n",
      "OV:\tYou were between.\n",
      "R:\tI was between jobs, so I lucked out there.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did you have any family obligations you couldn't make, or ...\n",
      "R:\tNo. It was only five days. I mean, I get to see my family, as I said, you know, once a year.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did you have any responsibilities on the inside that you had to take care ofchores, things they would tell you to do?\n",
      "R:\tNo, they never asked me to do anything.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you offered any services or programs during your stay? These would be related to health, or housing [01:33:00 crosstalk].\n",
      "R:\tThey never gave me my right doses of medicine.\n",
      "I:\tThey never did?\n",
      "R:\tNo, I never got my full blood pressure medication regime ever, in all of the five days. By the time I came out, my blood pressure was so crazy that, you know, it took me a week to recover.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how much were they cutting your dosage?\n",
      "R:\tLess than half.\n",
      "I:\tFor five days?\n",
      "R:\tFor five days.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so I definitely assume they were not offering you any health services or programs.\n",
      "R:\tThey brought me down to the nurse once, when I said, I'm not feeling well in the solitary. And she said, you know, I can't give you pills. I said, let my wife bring the pills. And they said, we can't do that. And she said, I don't have your pills. She said, drink water. Drink lots and lots of waterwhich is basically good advice for, yeah, untreated hypertension.\n",
      "I:\tWere there any things that were offered to you in terms of housing, or employment, ordid they ask you questions about that at all?\n",
      "R:\tNot at all. I did have an internment entrance interview. And I said, you know, I'm pretty much a political prisoner here. I'm in here for burning an American flag with an unjust charge. And I said, you know, maybe I should do aI told her, you know, what do you think would help my caseif I went on a hunger strike? And she said, don't do that.\n",
      "I:\tSo you got advice from someone\n",
      "R:\tFrom one person, you know, who was the first person to interview me when I came in. Oh, and I did get advice from the cops that took me from the Richmondnot the arresting officers, but the cops that took me from the Richmond to Bryant. In fact, they were the ones stuck with me in general. One of them was actually really fascinated by my work, and he wouldn't stop talking about it, because I was explaining to him that I quit working for [name] when they asked me to work on the Apache helicopter cannonthat they wanted it aimed with the eyes of the pilotbecause he was obviously military. And, you know, he knew about that system. And I said, yeah, well, it doesn't work as well as it could have. I don't work on weapons systems. So yeah, they said, don't tell anybody you burnt a flag.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that was the advice the cops gave you?\n",
      "R:\tYes. He said, don't tell anybody you burnt a flag. And I said, what? And they said, don't do it.\n",
      "I:\tDid they tell you what might happen, or did they just give you the advice?\n",
      "R:\tI said, what? Why? And I think the retort to that was, some of those people in there really love the flag. I mean, I lost all respect for the flag in 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated with obvious help from the government, you know. I was 10 years old. You know, I wasn't stupid, you know. It seemed like America took a stupid pill on that day.\n",
      "I:\tSo were there any services, aside from having your medication, that you would have liked to have had while you were there?\n",
      "R:\tNo. I just wanted out. A door would have been very nice.\n",
      "I:\tSo did your family outside your wife know what had happened?\n",
      "R:\tWe haven't told anyone. It stays between [name] and I.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how important were visits, and phone calls, and connections?\n",
      "R:\tThey were horrible. I mean, you know, they had to happen, but they were extremely stressful for both of us.\n",
      "I:\tBecause you didn't know what was going on?\n",
      "R:\tRightbecause neither one of us had any experience along these lines. There was no briefing. There was no outreach to her, where there should have been. I mean, that's a very serious crime, as she found out when she started calling lawyers the next day. I mean, you know, there should have been outreach.\n",
      "I:\tAnd when did your wife find out?\n",
      "R:\tShe was here when they took me away. Yeah, we live together.\n",
      "I:\tWell, I didn't know if she was away, and you had been taken when she did not know.\n",
      "R:\tNo, no, no.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you said one phone call a day for solitary.\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were those to your wife?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "OV:\tNo. If I may interject, there were more than one.\n",
      "R:\tOnce I got out of solitary.\n",
      "OV:\tOh no, even then, there was more than one.\n",
      "R:\tReally?\n",
      "OV:\tBecause that's why I set up the lawyers for you to see and all that. And I might add a little bit that it's very expensive for those calls, and we obviously have assets, but I think the average person ...\n",
      "R:\tWouldn't have the assets to keep up the phone calls. Those phones should be free.\n",
      "I:\tHow much time were you given on the phones?\n",
      "R:\tI don't remember being thrown off.\n",
      "I:\tSo you were able to make your phone call without being told to\n",
      "R:\tStop. Yeah, I don't think so.\n",
      "I:\tAnd while you were detained, did any of these things make it difficult to contact your family?\n",
      "R:\tMy wife was denied visitation.\n",
      "I:\tAnd why was that? Were you told?\n",
      "R:\tDenied.\n",
      "I:\tJust denied? They didn't give a reason?\n",
      "R:\tNo, denied.\n",
      "OV:\tNo, I wasn't allowed to go with him. They said, no, no, no, no.\n",
      "R:\tThat's all they said.\n",
      "OV:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I offered to bring his medication. No, absolutely not. You stay right here, lady.\n",
      "R:\tWell, what do you mean lack of transportation in this?\n",
      "I:\tLack of transportation for your family.\n",
      "R:\tOh, no. That's about it. I mean, there's no way in hell my family members were ever going to find out about it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you're talking about your family in New Jersey?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did you ever tell your daughter [01:40:47 inaudible]?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like your experiences affected your relationship at all with her?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you were eventually released before a decision on your case was made, right?\n",
      "R:\tYep. Well, I mean, if you call the decision dropping the two felony charges to a misdemeanor, a class B misdemeanor, that's a pretty big decision, isn't it? I mean, suddenly, they wanted $800,000. And I got from there to the point where, we should not have arrested you, should we have?\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you remember what conditions you were released under? So personal recognizance, bail?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, they have an alphabet soup for it.\n",
      "I:\tConditional release, supervised\n",
      "R:\tThat one, the second one. But I shouldn't have been in jail with what they charged me with before I left the jail.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was there any bail that was set for you?\n",
      "R:\tEight hundred thousand dollars.\n",
      "I:\tDid you pay any of that at any time?\n",
      "R:\tNo. I mean, we would have had to, you know, burglarize our entire retirement accounts. It was ridiculous, because they didn't have a leg to stand on. I mean, you know, I did not commit two felonies, and I just had to wait it out.\n",
      "I:\tAnd with the misdemeanor, did they fine you or anything?\n",
      "R:\tNope. In fact, they said they buried it, that nobody could find it. And I think that's more for their own, because, you know, if anybody could find it, I probably would have wound up suing the city.\n",
      "I:\tThe two felonies or the record of them?\n",
      "R:\tNo, the record of the misdemeanor. I'm pretty sure the record of the felonies have totally disappeared. At least, I'm assured they have.\n",
      "I:\tSo could you tell me about the process of being released? So you said that the guy came by your cell.\n",
      "R:\tWhispered it.\n",
      "I:\tSo how were you released? Did they transfer you somewhere else?\n",
      "R:\tNo, it was still in Bryant. I was on, you know, one of the upper floors. Some guy came; called off our names; told us to take our mattresses and personal effects, which, with mine, was the badge of honor.\n",
      "I:\tPiece of paper?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. And walked out of the cell. And then I guess that was around noon. You don't have a watch, and you can't see a clock.\n",
      "I:\tThere's no clock?\n",
      "R:\tThere's no clock; at least one that you could see, you know. So you know, I know by the time I got out of there, it was nighttime. And it was impossible to get transportation. What they told me was, the little wristband will get you on any bus for free.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the wristband was given to you by the jail?\n",
      "R:\tYes, the wristband you get when you first come in.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that stays on you the entire time?\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you given any advice on your way out?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\tDid you have any personal effects that you were given back?\n",
      "R:\tActually, I came out ahead.\n",
      "I:\tHow so?\n",
      "R:\tThey took me away in my stocking feet, and they gave me a pair of flip-flops when I left. But I had nothing in my pockets.\n",
      "I:\tSo you weren't ...\n",
      "R:\tWhich was actually a benefit, because if you have nothing in your personal effects, they don't dock you anything, and you get a certain minimum amount of stuff. So that was an interesting thing. I forgot all about this until you mentioned that. I would order for the other guys whatever they wanted.\n",
      "I:\tOrder what?\n",
      "R:\tEvery day, they came around with a sheet and what you wanted that day, and you were allowed so many items.\n",
      "I:\tFrom your own personal effects?\n",
      "R:\tFor your own personal use, like shampoo, and different types of food. You know, they only eat processed meat. I wouldn't eat any of the processed meat. So I gave my fellow inmates the processed meat, and I would eat the bread, which was good. I lost a few pounds.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so you would get things for the other guys that were with you?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah, just whatever they wanted. I'd check it for them. But that only happened twice, because, you know, I was only in general population for two days. You don't get that when you're in solitary.\n",
      "I:\tYou don't get any time with\n",
      "R:\tYou don't get the sheet that says what you want.\n",
      "I:\tAre you given anything at all?\n",
      "R:\tNothing. I asked for a book.\n",
      "I:\tAnd they denied you a book?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tDid you have any ...\n",
      "R:\tAnd he laughed.\n",
      "I:\tHe laughed at the fact that you asked for a book?\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tSo could you tell me about any concerns that you had as you were being released, or did you have any?\n",
      "R:\tI was high as a kite at that point.\n",
      "I:\tYou were just happy?\n",
      "R:\tEnmorphins?\n",
      "OV:\tEndorphins.\n",
      "R:\tEndorphins, yeah. I was flying on endorphins at that point. I was going to write a book. I was going to change the whole system. Then I woke up the next day and said, no, no.\n",
      "I:\tSo of these negative consequences, did you experience any of these?\n",
      "R:\tI couldn't work for a year. So which one of these is this? Because it's not that I lost my job, because I always had my job.\n",
      "I:\tI'll put that in other. And could you explain to me why?\n",
      "R:\tI was suffering extreme, severe PTSD.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was that from a specific instance within your experience, or was it the entire ...\n",
      "R:\tThe whole experience, yeah. You know, I'm very delicatetruly. I mean, I've never been through anything like that. And yeah, it bent me. It bent me for almost a solid year.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was there something that was particularly traumatic about ...\n",
      "R:\tThe whole unfairness.\n",
      "I:\tOf being ...\n",
      "R:\tRailroaded by my community, my immediate community that I've done so much for, and the fire department, and the police department. You know, I feel, you know, I don't want any part of it. You know, we're looking into moving to Europe. It's at least civilized there.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, you mentioned Norway before.\n",
      "R:\tOh, no, Italy.\n",
      "I:\tWarm and\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tSo was your experience in detention any different from what you thought it would be prior to that?\n",
      "R:\tI never thought of being in detention before.\n",
      "I:\tYou had no preconception as to what it might be like?\n",
      "R:\tNo, absolutely not, because I'm a straight arrow. I mean, you know, I even stopped smoking marijuana years ago, you know. I mean, I had a brush with certain early members of the computer community that ...\n",
      "I was participating in what we call black hat activities in the late '70s. And one of our group was arrested by the federal police. And he was placed in prison, federal prison. And he got free healthcare. They gave him ECS three times a week.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what is that?\n",
      "R:\tElectroconvulsive shock. And by the time he came out, his brain was fried.\n",
      "I:\tAnd\n",
      "R:\tBut it was therapy.\n",
      "I:\tThat was court-ordered for him?\n",
      "R:\tIt had to be. I mean, you know, he wouldn't ask for it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was this person close to you at the time?\n",
      "R:\tWe were very close. Together, we wrote the first word processor for the IBM PC.\n",
      "I:\tAnd can you describe, for my understanding, a black hat situation, just an example, maybe?\n",
      "R:\tThe device we built enabled my friend, my coworker, to dial Richard Nixon on the CIA hotline and ask for more toilet paper for the CIA. Is that black hat enough for you?\n",
      "I:\tYes, that is.\n",
      "R:\tAnd they got him, and they destroyed his brain. And from that point onI mean, I did the normal stuff that kids did. You know, we hooked up the elevators in the computer science building so anybody that we didn't like got a ride.\n",
      "I:\tGot an infinite ride on the elevator?\n",
      "R:\tPretty much. I mean, you know, we used to have games where we used to walk pieces of computer equipment across the room by writing programs that'll find the fundamental frequency of them.\n",
      "I:\tThat's fascinating.\n",
      "R:\tWell, yeah, you do that stuff, but then you find out that, you know, the federal government frowns on that a lot. And ever since then, I've been straight as an arrow in everything. I've done work for [name], and, you know, I did a lot of work for [name] in getting medical information out of what they call the Desert Theater to the hospitals in Frankfurt, and San Antonio, and Maryland, in order to save the lives of the brain-dead guys that were coming out of there, you knowwhich, you know, makes me feel even more betrayed, because, you know, I worked really hard for these son of a bitches.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the black hat situationhow old were you at the time?\n",
      "R:\t20s.\n",
      "I:\tAnd these are mostly experiences in your 20s, you would say?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd going back to the detentiondid you feel like you were changed in a way?\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was there anything good that came out of it?\n",
      "R:\tNothing.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the biggest way you were changed was\n",
      "R:\tComplete distress in the American system.\n",
      "I:\tAnd is there anything more you would like to add to that topic?\n",
      "R:\tI think we pretty much covered it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you participated in a diversion program, or ...\n",
      "R:\tYeah. That's another thing that pissed me off about the lawyer. She wanted to start moving it into court. And I read the transcripts. And the judge looked at her and said, I really think we should put this in the diversion program. And she said, well, okaybecause I'm sure she thought she would have gotten more money out of us if, you know, we didn't go into diversion. But diversion cost me money, because I had to hire a psychologist, and I had to go to a psychologist some number of times. And I got a certificate that I'm all better.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how were you first informed about pretrial diversion as an option? Do you remember?\n",
      "R:\tPossibly that very same attorney, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tIt was brought up as\n",
      "R:\tAs one of my legal choices.\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you feel like she helped you make a decision, or\n",
      "R:\tNo, she was a total raving bitch that was only in it for the money.\n",
      "I:\tSo an interview is often conducted at the very beginning of pretrial for eligibility. Do you remember that occurring?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, I went down. They have an office around the corner from Bryant. And this black woman just wanted to hug me. I remember that now.\n",
      "I:\t[01:54:16 crosstalk]?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. You could see it in heryou poor SOB, you know. She just said, you're not going to be any trouble for anybody. She didn't go as far as saying it was just horseshit, but the empathy I felt from her, even in my autistic condition.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did she ask you questions about\n",
      "R:\tWho I was, what I did, you know. She already had my whole record, which was blank.\n",
      "I:\tAnd would you say that the diversion staff treated you well?\n",
      "R:\tYes, very well. In fact, it was really nice, because they allowed me to attend a group that halved the number of paid sessions I had to go to, to the private psychologist. They had a sort of group thing that qualified for the psychological element. And then I had to pay the guy downstairs $2.50 for his flag. And then I had to pay the association $80 to clean up the smoke spots that I did not put on the wall, but they said I did.\n",
      "I:\tFrom the same incident?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd so you had to pay those fees for those\n",
      "R:\tTo end theand then that whole thing got packaged up, sent to the judge. The lawyer didn't even bother to show up. The judge just said, okay, this never happened. We shall not talk about this again. I think he was Klingon.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you ever aware of a level of risk that was assigned to you?\n",
      "R:\tHuh?\n",
      "I:\tSo offenders can be labeled low risk, medium risk, high risk. Were you ever aware of any of those labels being assigned to you?\n",
      "R:\tNo, and I would think that low risk was a little too high for me.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you ever aware of a needs assessment? So something where they ask you about ...\n",
      "R:\tI mean, you know, I told them immediately, I could afford anything you could throw at me, you know.\n",
      "I:\tAnd at the beginning of the program, how much did you feel like it would reduce your odds of reoffending?\n",
      "R:\tWill I ever burn an American flag again? Not unless I'm not in America.\n",
      "I:\tSo you're optimistic about the program, or\n",
      "R:\tWhen I get to Italy, if there's a flag-burning, count on me.\n",
      "I:\tSo those feelings didn't come from the program, though.\n",
      "R:\tHmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm [no].\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you feel like race or ethnicity played a part in any of your diversion experience?\n",
      "R:\tI think the guys in the cell thought I was Hispanic, because when I first got there, they started all speaking Spanish to me. I don't think I had as much of a beard, either. I had something of a beard. Yeah. They knew I wasn't white, to California standard.\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you remember which diversion program you participated in?\n",
      "R:\tMaybe it was Project 22? No, no, I don't remember any. It definitely wasn't Neighborhood Court; wasn't Involvement Team. That's what I was originally released upon. Oh, pretrial diversionthat's it. They could put the spacing a little better on those.\n",
      "I:\tOn the wording?\n",
      "R:\t[01:58:56 inaudible] get the right button. It's not as if they're taking up the whole page for these things.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how much did it cost you to participate in diversion? Do you remember?\n",
      "R:\tI think the whole total was $2,500 for the private psychologist, and then it was $85 in restitution. I think they had a fee tacked on, but I don't remember what it was. It was not any onerous fee; at least, you know, I didn't think it was an onerous fee.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the conditions of your participation were\n",
      "R:\tThat I go to a psychologist, make restitution, and show up once a week at their office. I think that's the whole thing. And I had the whole thing done in a month.\n",
      "I:\tDo you remember how many sessions you had to attend, or\n",
      "R:\tA dozen, maybe. Yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were there any special conditions to your participation that you remember?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you said one month, it took you?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. I was done with their requirements in about a month.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did the program do anything to address your needs?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, it got me out of having a record of any sort. So you know, that was my major concern. You know, I didn't want anybody to be able to, you know, write a letter and ask, you know, if I was ever arrested. And supposedly, that doesn't happen. I think the only way the arrest can be recorded is from law enforcement agency to law enforcement agency. I don't think anybody on the outside could look at it. At least, that's what the lawyer told me, but she was a worthless bitch anyway.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like you got any benefits from participation, in personal relationships, education?\n",
      "R:\tI mean, most of the benefits are negative.\n",
      "I:\tIn what way?\n",
      "R:\tAbsolutely knowing that, you know, I cannot rely on my government or my community for anythingmy immediate community here. That's a benefit. So yeah, I know that, you know, I'll never let them take advantage of me again.\n",
      "I:\tWas there anything about your program that you felt was particularly helpful for you?\n",
      "R:\tNo. I'll reiterate the thing that I said before: There's no record.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that was\n",
      "R:\tThat's the only benefit I can think of that is out of the system. You know, the psychological benefit is, you know, I have zero trust. And that, I deem as a benefit at this point.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the negative consequences were\n",
      "R:\tWell, apparently, you know, there aren't any. I mean, my old clients are still calling me. I got a new client, and it's, you know, a particularly, you know, large organization that checks out everybody that works for them, a very paranoid organization. I didn't get anything about, you knownone of the military came for the door, you know, becauseI didn't have clearance, but I did work on secret programs. And, you know, there was no spit back on that. So I'm pretty sure that, you know, it got as buried as it can get in our open society. Actually, what do they call it? The surveillance society. It's as closed-mouth as it possibly can. I don't think it's affected me getting more business. As I said, you know, I couldn't work for a year because of, you know, the PTSD. So I already took off my year from my decade herenot intentionally.\n",
      "I:\tSo were you with other program participants, or\n",
      "R:\tIn the group therapy thing. It was very scary.\n",
      "I:\tWhy do you say that?\n",
      "R:\tPeople I would never, ever associate with.\n",
      "I:\tDescribe them for me.\n",
      "R:\tStupid, bigoted, uneducated, angry. I mean, angry for no real reason. That was scary. That was in the group therapy group. So I did the minimum number of those, just to make sure, you know.\n",
      "I:\tWere there any participants that you got along with?\n",
      "R:\tNope. It was like my high school; I don't want to see anybody.\n",
      "I:\tAnd could you tell me about the staff that you interacted with?\n",
      "R:\tThe staff there were allyou know, perhaps I was a breath of fresh air to me, because, you know, they knew I wasn't supposed to be there, you knowat least I still have that kind of thought process about meis that, you know, the whole thing was, you know, a scam, a setup. You know, in my mind, I think they alland they, too, told me, don't say you burned a flag.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, continuing advice.\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program?\n",
      "R:\tNo. Yeah, I didn't like how much money it took out of my wallet, especially for that psychologist, you know.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, but that was something that you were able to set up privately. That was your ...\n",
      "R:\tThat was my choice. I could have, you know, gone throughbut that would have taken three months. And instead, I wanted it done in a month. You know, I wanted to get thisand I think that's why, you know, the judge wiped it immediately. He didn't ask to see me. I was never before a judge.\n",
      "I:\tAfter your release ...\n",
      "R:\tAt any time in the whole process. I was never in a courtroom.\n",
      "I:\tSo it was just communication between you and your attorney?\n",
      "R:\tRight.\n",
      "I:\tAnd pretrial diversion.\n",
      "R:\tRight. And I got a copy of the entire record. And what I know of my neighbors now justyeah. It's all in the emails, because they submitted emails.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were you ever accused of violating the program?\n",
      "R:\tNo. I think that would have been impossible.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how did it end? So you got your certificate.\n",
      "R:\tGot my certificate from the private psychologist. When I went to the last group, and I announced, I'm a graduate, you know, the guy there said, you know, you could come back anytime you want. Yeah, bud. Yeah, I will. Did I say the people there were toxic, too?\n",
      "I:\tNo, you did not.\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you're talking about the participants?\n",
      "R:\tThe participants were pretty toxic, not the staff. The staffI don't know how they do that kind of job. I really have no idea. I'm not a people person.\n",
      "I:\tSo you were given the certificate. You didn't have to go to court again.\n",
      "R:\tNever went to court.\n",
      "I:\tWas there a graduation thing, or any other documentation for the termination of the program?\n",
      "R:\tNo. They just sent me a paper saying, you did everything in the maila receipt.\n",
      "I:\tAnd to what extent do you agree with the following statement? \"Overall, the program was very helpful.\"\n",
      "R:\tFor me, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you say that, as I've heard, because your criminal record is clear. Was there another reason you would say it's very helpful?\n",
      "R:\tNope, not at all.\n",
      "I:\tWas there something particularly unhelpful or counterproductive about the program?\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\tWould you recommend it to others?\n",
      "R:\tIf they could get in it, of course, yeah. One really happy thing they didthe guy downstairsinstead of asking for his $2.50 for the flagdid I say it was $2.50?\n",
      "I:\tYes, you did.\n",
      "R:\tHe asked for $670 so he could set up a surveillance system.\n",
      "I:\tAnd was that complaint ever received by anyone?\n",
      "R:\tBy the ...\n",
      "I:\tThe HOA?\n",
      "R:\tNo, by the people ...\n",
      "I:\tAt diversion?\n",
      "R:\tAt diversion.\n",
      "I:\tOh, as a restitution.\n",
      "R:\tAs a restitution. And they said, denied. Denied. So yeah, and they gave me a little satisfaction on that.\n",
      "I:\tAnd are there any issues you think that need addressing with how the diversion staff treats its clients?\n",
      "R:\tJeez, that's a tough question, because, you know, I didn't belong there. And the people that belong thereyou know, I don't know how they felt. So you knowthat's too hard of a question for me to answer.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did the program prepare you to deal with challenges after you were all done?\n",
      "R:\tNo, no. They didn't come here and arrest the guy downstairs, okay? Now that would have been goodfor false accusation and all that, you know.\n",
      "I:\tAnd kind of going back to that situation where you were in 850 Bryant, what was the first day like for you after your release? Do you remember what you did?\n",
      "R:\tI had a nice meal with my wife. And I fell into a major depression. And over the next month, I would wake up in sweats. And it was not a pleasant time at all.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like you were able to go outside and interact with people?\n",
      "R:\tNo, no, I stayed inside. But I normally stay inside anyway. I mean, I go out, ride my bicycle occasionally. Even less now, when that poor lady got hit. Right on my bike routes, somebody, you know, 50 miles an hour in the park killed a woman. Yeah. The shine is coming off San Francisco, especially now we find out the taxpayers are going to have to pay for the Millennium Falcon or whatever they call it.\n",
      "I:\tOh, I'm not familiar with that.\n",
      "R:\tOh, the Millennium Tower is tilting.\n",
      "I:\tOh, yeah.\n",
      "R:\tAnd we're going to pay for it, because we want our public transportation system, whichthe people that live there never use public transportation. They have chauffeurs, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tSo going back to the ...\n",
      "R:\tSorry.\n",
      "I:\tNo, no, it's okay. It's okay. After you were releasedso did you know what you were going to do next, the first day that you got out?\n",
      "R:\tTake my medication.\n",
      "I:\tSeems like a good thing to do.\n",
      "R:\tYeah. I mean, that's as far ahead that I was thinkingand help heal my wife, because I think she took more of a hit than I did emotionally, even though, you knowyeah, I think she took more of an emotional hit on it than I did.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like you were able to support that relationship and mend things when you got home?\n",
      "R:\tYes, yes, we healed well.\n",
      "I:\tAnd about how long do you feel like that took?\n",
      "R:\t[name]?\n",
      "OV:\tI don't know.\n",
      "R:\tAt least six months. She doesn't like to talk about herself.\n",
      "I:\tAnd what was the toughest adjustment that you had to make in the first month?\n",
      "R:\tFreeing myself of my nightmares, I guess, because I do something called intentional dreaming. I do a lot of my work at night in the sleep state. I do a lot of my computer design work then. And it was very hard to get that back. I'm there now. I mean, you know, I could dream of code all night now. But that first year, it was lost.\n",
      "I:\tAnd do you feel like your work was affected because of that?\n",
      "R:\tOh yeah, I didn't work. I didn't even look for jobs. In fact, I called myself retired when everybody called. And I could have. I mean, you know, it's not as if I had to work. But then, you know, this major global company came around, and, you know, that is moreyou know, getting this job with all these people that respect me across the world is, you know, more the thing, besides my wife's support, that's the thing that has healed me much more, even though, you know, it's a pain in the ass working with 20-something-year-olds. But I'm literally the oldest guy in the company. And, you know, it's still fun. Also, I've never worked with women in the office before.\n",
      "I:\tIs that something you do now?\n",
      "R:\tOver half the population are women. And, you know, what surprises me the most is how many of them become pregnant.\n",
      "I:\tIn the workplace?\n",
      "R:\tI don't know if they did it there.\n",
      "I:\tSo I assume that they go on leave, and you see this all the time.\n",
      "R:\tWell, I've never been around pregnant women in my whole life. I mean, the only woman that worked in my previous companies ran the taco truck. And you can tell if she was pregnant. But here, you knowit's kind of bizarre, you know. Life goes on, you know.\n",
      "I:\tSo going back to the release, how did you support yourself financially at the time?\n",
      "R:\tSavings. I mean, that's normal for my kind of business. You know, you have stretches where, as [name] said\n",
      "OV:\tFeast or famine.\n",
      "I:\tAnd following your release, were you given access to any programs, to healthcare ...\n",
      "R:\tDidn't need it; didn't ask for it. Oh, we did get Obamacare. And it took our $1,600 a month Kaiser bill down to $350 or $450, something like that.\n",
      "OV:\tIt's $425. Yeah, [02:16:57 inaudible].\n",
      "R:\tSo we got Obamacare because I wasn't working. That was the amazing part about it. You know, we filled out the forms, and then they weren't working, so we called. And she justyeah, we're going to pay for most of your medical bill. And that took a big amount of the stingyeah, $1,600 a month is a lot for healthcare.\n",
      "I:\tAnd were there any programs or services post-jail that you would have wanted that weren't offered?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, I mean, I think, ideally, there should have been aI mean, the whole thing stank to high heaven. I mean, just having the charges reduced by that much. I really think somebody from the Attorney General's office should have investigated and arrested the guy downstairs who obviously filed false police reports. I mean, you know, I've read all the emails, because the lawyer did give me the entire case fileand probably because she doesn't own a filing cabinet. You know, I got the whole thing, and I read all the emails and all the reports. I mean, every single neighbor had something bad to say about me, because I got the police reports of all their interviews. And I think that the District Attorney's office should have investigated this, and brought those people to justice.\n",
      "I:\tDo you feel like your detention affected the relationship with your family members for the better or for the worse?\n",
      "R:\tFamily members outsideit was worse between my wife and I for a while. But, you know, we did rebuild.\n",
      "I:\tAnd that was something you felt initially?\n",
      "R:\tYeah. I mean, she was just as much in a state of shock as I was.\n",
      "I:\tBecause it was just between you and your wife, the rest of your family didn't provide you with any support?\n",
      "R:\tThey don't know about it, and they never will.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did your relationship with your friends change for the better or for the worse?\n",
      "R:\tI did drop one friend, because two friends, we could not stop from having the information, because, you know, they were here. You know, they were regular visitors, and they would show up, and I wouldn't be here. Where's [name], you know? And one of them told a third friend, which to them was a friend, but to us was, you know, an acquaintance. And I jettisoned him immediately, and told him, never talk to anybody about that. And I don't want to see you ever again.\n",
      "I:\tAnd did your other friends provide you with any support after what happened?\n",
      "R:\tSympathy. That's about it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you did not tell your daughter, so your relationship did not change.\n",
      "R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. Didn't tell my mother, either.\n",
      "I:\tAnd following your release, how many places did you live within the first year? You've been here this whole time?\n",
      "R:\tOh, yeah. We moved in here in '96. You know what the rent is on this place when we move out?\n",
      "OV:\t[name].\n",
      "R:\tIn case you're looking.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, just in case I can't afford it. So what are the pros and cons to living here for you, both then and now?\n",
      "R:\tBefore, I felt like a member of a community. I felt like I participated. I felt like, you know, I was, you know, appreciated. And once I read through all those emails, found out that was a total illusion. They were just using me. So there's pro/con there. Physically, it has not changed. I'm living in heaven, okay? I have the ocean across the street. I have the grocery store across the street. I have one of the most beautiful urban parks in the world across the street. I could walk to three major world-class museums. I mean, yeah, that has not changed. What has changed is my attitude about my city, which, you know, it sucks.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the pros and cons of living here nowhave those changed at all, like your relationships with the HOA or with your neighbors?\n",
      "R:\tThey fined us $2,000.\n",
      "I:\tFor?\n",
      "R:\tFor this whole incident. On top of everything, then they turn around; they throwand the maximum fine they were able to throw was $150. But then they changed the rules so they could fine me $2,000. And they'll get that money over my dead body.\n",
      "I:\tSo you have not paid that fine.\n",
      "R:\tOh no. They can't charge interest on it.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how do you tell them that you can't pay it or won't pay it?\n",
      "R:\tWe won't pay it. We just pay our dues every month, exactly on time.\n",
      "I:\tAnd are you receiving any negative consequences because of that?\n",
      "R:\tOh, all the time. Yeah, they keep on writing, must be paid, must be paid. No, they'll get it over my dead body. Then my daughter will find out.\n",
      "I:\tSo we're going to go to the strongly agree to strongly disagree. These are statements about your neighborhood. And this is immediately following your release. \"In my first month out, I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live.\"\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\t\"It was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood.\"\n",
      "R:\tIt's not hard to stay out of trouble. You know, there's no trouble here, unless you're a stupid guy that goes into the water.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, not that one. \"I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood.\"\n",
      "R:\tYes.\n",
      "I:\tAnd who were they?\n",
      "R:\tThe guy that falsely accused me and the entire HOA board members.\n",
      "I:\t\"Drug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood.\"\n",
      "R:\tOne guy offered to sell me Viagra once.\n",
      "I:\tSo I assume it's not a major problem, then.\n",
      "R:\tI don't think it is.\n",
      "I:\t\"I think my neighborhood was a good place to live.\"\n",
      "R:\tYeah, it is. It's a very good place to live, as long as, you know, you don't have assholes for neighbors.\n",
      "I:\t\"I cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions.\"\n",
      "R:\tNo, not anymore. Used to; not anymore.\n",
      "I:\tBefore the incident?\n",
      "R:\tYeah.\n",
      "I:\t\"If there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who lived there could get it resolved.\"\n",
      "R:\tNope.\n",
      "I:\t\"I expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time.\"\n",
      "R:\tWell, our original planwe still may come back, when we get into our 80s. You know, I mean, it is an ideal place to, you know, check out from.\n",
      "I:\tAnd the statements I just read you immediately following your releasedo you feel the exact same way now about your neighborhood?\n",
      "R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. It was all real-time.\n",
      "I:\tBecause you haven't changed your place of residence.\n",
      "R:\tNo, I haven't changed. I don't forgive people. I'm not Christian. But then I don't take revenge, eitherwhich is, when you come to think of it, very Christian.\n",
      "I:\tAnd with regard to housing, what are your future goals, and how do you want to achieve them?\n",
      "R:\tItaly, probably around Florence.\n",
      "I:\tAnd how long do you think that's away?\n",
      "R:\tWell, it was going to be this year, but now what we're looking at is at least a year and a half, but the global company who's doing an installation in Milan  you know, I may be able to move to Italy sooner than what I thought. The nice thing about moving to Italy for me is, I spend a year without crossing the border, and I'm an Italian citizen. I get an EU passport, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tIs that something that you want?\n",
      "R:\tOh, yeah. Don't you want one?\n",
      "I:\tYeah.\n",
      "R:\tYou know, with an EU passport, you could go to school for free.\n",
      "I:\tSo moving onto criminal recordto what extent do you agree with the following statement? \"Having a criminal record has made it very difficult for me to find work.\"\n",
      "R:\tOh, it does.\n",
      "I:\tIt does?\n",
      "R:\tNo question about it, in my field of work.\n",
      "I:\tBut have you experienced that personally?\n",
      "R:\tNo, because I have no criminal record [02:27:04 crosstalk]. But, you know, it's a fact, you know. Somebody that could do to a computer what I could do to a computeryou don't want him if he's been arrested.\n",
      "I:\tAnd is that something you ever had to tell an employer or anything like that?\n",
      "R:\tNo, no, because, you know, everything's expunged.\n",
      "I:\tAnd where do you see yourself in terms of employment in the next year?\n",
      "R:\tMost likely the same contract.\n",
      "I:\tNext five years?\n",
      "R:\tRetired, 100 percent.\n",
      "I:\tAnd I assume ten years is the same?\n",
      "R:\tOh, yeah. Well, you know, I'll still be doing my mentoring thing, you know. We stick mostly to young ladies that, you know, are trying to start a technology company.\n",
      "I:\tIs there a reason for that?\n",
      "R:\tI get along much better with women than I do with men. [Name] does, too. And yeah, I'm not a man's man. I never was. I prefer the company of women.\n",
      "I:\tAnd moving onto financial obligations, have you incurred any debt because of your contact with the criminal justice system?\n",
      "R:\tDebt? No. Well, except the thing I mentioned already.\n",
      "I:\tYeah, the fine that you're not going to pay.\n",
      "R:\tRight.\n",
      "I:\tAnd in general, how would you say your criminal justice obligations have affected your life? And these are court dates; these are diversion requirements; obligations.\n",
      "R:\tIt made a major effect on me, a complete loss of faith in the United States.\n",
      "I:\tAnd you're saying that about\n",
      "R:\tMy contact with the criminal system here, yeah. I've lost all faith.\n",
      "I:\tIs there anything that's important to you that we haven't talked about today?\n",
      "R:\tWe've touched on a lot, you know. I'm a ruminator, you know. As I said, a lot of my good thinking is done in my sleep. So you know, you'd have to ask me that question tomorrow, because something may or may not pop up, yeah.\n",
      "I:\tIs there anything that you would suggest for us in future contact, because these are sensitive subjects?\n",
      "R:\tDon't you dare let anybody find this stuff out, okay? You already know that my family doesn't know. And I'm making it quite clear that if any employer has access to this information, you know, I'm fired, okay? So you know, I mean, I realize she had a little bit of a disclaimer in there, but I would ask you personally to make sure that these are randomized as quickly as possible.\n",
      "I:\tNot a problem.\n",
      "R:\tDoes [name] have to see it with my name on it?\n",
      "I:\tShe will not see it with your name on it.\n",
      "R:\tCool. So please commit to me, as your personal responsibility, that this is totally anonymized, because I am used to this, you know, because with HIPAA and all of the medical stuff I've been doing all my life, I know it's perfectly possible to detach the data from the person. And, you know, please do your job on that.\n",
      "I:\tAbsolutely. And do you have any questions for me about the study or anything like that?\n",
      "R:\tAre you going to get your name on the paper?\n",
      "I:\tMaybe. That's a possibility.\n",
      "R:\tThat would be very cool; a sharing PA.\n",
      "I:\tQuite possibly [02:30:57 crosstalk].\n",
      "R:\tA principal investigator, right? [Name] is the PI, and you're ...\n",
      "I:\tAn RA for now.\n",
