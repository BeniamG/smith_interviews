       "'Interview: SF657\\nI:\\tSo, before we get started on the interview, I just kind of want to go over some logistics first. I guess the first question is can you hear me okay?\\nR:\\tI can hear you perfectly.\\nI:\\tGreat. So the first thing is, would you be able to give me your address? We’re compensating our interviewees $40--\\nR:\\tSo here’s what I’m going to ask you. I work [inaudible 1:26] program of recovery right now, and I see this as part of my service that I can make amends.\\nI:\\tOkay. \\nR:\\tAnd I’d like you to donate that money, if you could really do this, is to The Safe House. The Safe House is actually a place in San Francisco that gets women off the street who have been in prostitution. If you could instead of giving it to me, if you guys could make a check out to them and give them money I would really appreciate it.\\nI:\\tThat’s really wonderful of you. Yes, I believe we’ve had other respondents ask the same, and I believe that that is possible. So I can talk with the lead researcher, and I will let you know.\\nR:\\tThat’s fine.\\nI:\\tWe do need to send you a consent form. I’m going to walk you through the consent form and ask for your verbal approval, but is there an address--either an email address or mailing address--that we can send a hard copy of the consent form to?\\nR:\\tYes. And nothing I say is going to have my name in it, right?\\nI:\\tThat’s correct. Yes. I’ll go through that in more detail. Yes.\\nR:\\t[gives address]\\nI:\\tGreat. So I’m going to walk you through the consent form right now. Feel free to stop me if you have any clarification questions. I’m just going to read it. Just ask me if you have any questions. \\nR:\\t[Inaudible 3:13].\\nI:\\tYou’re cutting out a little bit.\\nR:\\t[Inaudible 3:25].\\nI:\\tThat’s fine. The other thing, too, is when we get to the interview--I don’t know if you have headphones or something; sometimes when folks have the phone on speaker it can be hard if we go ahead and record--if you give your permission for us to record. \\nR:\\tI’m on a headset. [Inaudible 3:44].\\nI:\\tGreat. So introduction and purpose. My name is Sandra Smith--Sandra Smith is not me, but she is the lead researcher--and I’m a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley in the department of Sociology. I would like to invite you to take part in my research study. I am interested in learning more about your experiences with the criminal justice system so that I can better understand the effects of diversion programs and pretrial detention. What I learn from this study might help to inform local and national conversations about reforms to the criminal justice system. \\nIf you agree to participate in my research, I--or another trained researcher--will conduct an interview with you at the time of your choosing. The interview will involve questions about your experiences with the criminal justice system, and how you have fared personally, socially, and financially over the past few years. \\nMany questions have multiple choice responses, but there will be times when I will ask you to elaborate. The interview should last between an hour and a-half and two hours. With your permission the interview will be audio recorded using a digital recorder. The recoding is to accurately record the information you provide, and will be used for transcription purposes only. \\nIf you choose not to be recorded, notes will be taken instead. If you agree to begin being recorded, but feel uncomfortable at any time, the recorder can be turned off at your request. And if you don’t want to continue, you can stop the interview at any time as well. \\nWe expect to conduct only one interview. However, follow-ups may be needed for added clarification on any points you have made. If so, a member of our team will contact you by mail or phone. \\nAnd then a little bit about benefits. I do not expect you to experience any direct benefit from your participation in this study. My hope is that research findings will represent a contribution to our general knowledge of diversion programs and pretrial detention. If you’re interested, we are happy to share with you documents that are prepared based on the findings from this study. \\nAnd so because the interview includes questions on sensitive topics--such as experiences with the criminal justice system--there is a risk that you might become upset and/or feel uncomfortable. Some respondents may feel sadness or anger while sharing their experiences. You may, however, refuse to answer any of the questions posed during the course of this interview. And you may request that the recording be halted at any point.\\nYour participation is completely voluntary. Furthermore, whether or not you choose to participate in the research--and whether or not you choose to answer a question or continue participating--there will not be any penalty to you or loss of the benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. \\nDigital recordings are sent to a transcriptionist, so an additional risk is associated with a possible breach of confidentiality. In an attempt to ensure your confidentiality will not be breached by the transcriptionist, the transcriptionist will sign a confidentiality agreement. \\nSo the last part is confidentiality. \\nR:\\tThey will not have my address, right?\\nI:\\tThat’s correct. That is correct. That is kept with us only. And that will be destroyed, once we send you the confidentiality agreement.\\nR:\\tGot it. All right.\\nI:\\tSo you will be asked for signed consent, which we will send to you. And all of the information you provide will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used. As with all research, however, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised--however, I am taking precautions to minimize this risk. No actual names will be used in any published materials concerning the study. Your identity will be kept on a master list that is maintained by the researcher, and the transcript will be coded to protect privacy.\\nR:\\tThere is one thing. Do you have every word verbatim, or can you just [inaudible 7:37]? I feel uncomfortable with people reading word-for-word verbatim.\\nI:\\tYeah, that’s fair. \\nR:\\tIf we’re going to do this, I just feel more comfortable … now, in the survey, I understand. You have to do that. But right now I’m just getting frustrated with this going word-for-word verbatim. I agree to what you’re saying. I believe in it. I am going to ask of you as well, is after we’re done--because I want to get my records sealed. I am going to ask you guys to send me a letter, saying, “[Name] participated in this. It was helpful.” Or something to that effect.\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tThat’s what I’m asking.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. I think that won’t be a problem.\\n[Interruption] \\nR:\\tSorry about that; I just had a family thing I had to deal with.\\nI:\\tNo worries. Are you good to go?\\nR:\\tYes. Anyway, you can send [inaudible 11:07] after I’ve participated. Is that right?\\nI:\\tYes. I believe so. I don’t want to make any promises. I need to double-check that with the research director. But I have noted that and I will follow up with her.\\nR:\\tOkay, got it. So let’s go through the … I want to make this as quick as possible. I know it’s going to take an hour and a-half, but let’s cut through a lot of stuff. I’m okay with … I understand you’re going to try to protect my confidentiality as much as possible. There’s going to be a non-disclose by the person who is doing the transcript. Got it. Okay.\\nI:\\tWe’ll destroy the digital recordings of the interviews after the research. The only other thing I would say is that the transcripts or notes may be saved for future research, but they’ll be destroyed within … they’ll be kept for up to ten years and then destroyed.\\nR:\\tWhat is going to be kept? But it’s not going to have my name in, right?\\nI:\\tNo, no. \\nR:\\tOkay.\\nI:\\tThe transcripts will have not your name. We’re coding them with non-identifiable things.\\nR:\\tAll right. That’s fine.\\nI:\\tGreat. So can you just give me verbal consent.\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tCool. And then verbal consent you’re okay with us recording. Is that correct?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. Thank you so much. So because I am over the phone it’s harder to kind of … sometimes it can be harder, being conducted over the phone. So if you are kind of feeling like you need a break or anything, or a question anytime--just kind of flag it and let me know.\\nR:\\tOkay.\\nI:\\tLet’s begin with your current circumstances. I’m going to start with a few questions about your background, your relationships, and your experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. So starting with your background, the first questions is how old are you?\\nR:\\tYou’re cutting out, by the way.\\nI:\\tIs this better?\\nR:\\tIt sounds like it’s breaking up. \\n[Dealing with technical issues.]\\nI:\\tSo, how old are you?\\nR:\\tI’m 47.\\nI:\\tAnd then what day when you born?\\nR:\\tNovember 12th, 1969.\\nI:\\tWhere were you born?\\nR:\\tLowell, Massachusetts.\\nI:\\tAnd are you a US citizen?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tWhat is your gender?\\nR:\\tMale. \\nI:\\tAnd please choose from the list that I’m going to read to you the category or categories that best describe how you self-identify in terms of race.\\nR:\\tCaucasian.\\nI:\\tAnd please choose from this list how others perceive you in terms of race and ethnicity?\\nR:\\tCaucasian. Sorry. I don’t have a lot of patience for that shit.\\nI:\\tThat’s fine. And what is your present marital status?\\nR:\\tSingle.\\nI:\\tSingle, never married?\\nR:\\tSingle, never married. Correct.\\nI:\\tAnd how many children do you have?\\nR:\\tNone.\\nI:\\tAnd what is the highest level of education that you’ve completed?\\nR:\\tFour years of college.\\nI:\\tAnd then check all that apply. How do you support yourself financially; no support, job or jobs--\\nR:\\tJob.\\nI:\\tSupport from family?\\nR:\\tNo. No support except for my job.\\nI:\\tOkay. About how much money do you earn? \\nR:\\tI’m in sales, so I’d says on average about $300,000 [inaudible 15:45].\\nI:\\tAnd that’s per year?\\nR:\\tIn the ballpark, yeah. I mean, it fluctuates a little bit. But yeah, in the ballpark.\\nI:\\tAnd so I would assume for the next question--what is your total household income--that you would fall into the category, then--\\nR:\\tThe same.\\nI:\\tSo now we’re going to move to talk about a little bit about relationships and social support. I am going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationship with family. And to clarify, “family” means blood or legal relative and significant others, or guardians. \\nR:\\tGot it.\\nI:\\tSo the first question is “I feel close to my family.” Strongly agree? Agree? Neutral? Disagree? Or strongly disagree?\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“I want my family to be involved in my life.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree. Not all of them. Not every member, but yes. [Laugh]\\nI:\\t[Laugh]\\nR:\\tNot [inaudible 16:45] family, so--\\nI:\\tYes, yes. “I consider myself a source of support for my family.”\\nR:\\tHow do you define that?\\nI:\\tI mean, I guess it’s pretty open in terms of I guess it could be financial support, emotional support; but do you feel that you provide your family with any kind of support?\\nR:\\tEmotional support, I think. Yeah.\\nI:\\tOkay. And is that agree, or strongly agree?\\nR:\\tStrongly agree, yeah.\\nI:\\tAnd then, I guess on the flip side, do you feel your family is a source of support for you? Again, either financial or emotional?\\nR:\\tStrongly agree. Always going to be emotion[?] in that way. So I’d say strongly agree.\\nI:\\t“I fight a lot with my family members.”\\nR:\\tNo. Strongly disagree.\\nI:\\t“I often feel like I disappoint my family.”\\nR:\\tUmm … disagree. [Inaudible 17:56] one family [inaudible] family. It could be one person in the family that disagree … that you butt heads with. So I would say the other one would be disagree, as opposed to strongly disagree. Because [inaudible] family is all-encompassing. So all it takes is one bad apple and your family-- Anyway. Skew the results.\\nI:\\tAnd then the last question is, “I am criticized a lot by my family.”\\nR:\\tI am what?\\nI:\\tCriticized a lot by my family. \\nR:\\tI’d say strong disagree. I’d say disagree. Disagree. There is one person in the family that’s kind of … anyway.\\nI:\\tAnd it sounds like for the most part you have a very good relationship, but then there are maybe one or two individuals you’re not as close to.\\nR:\\tWell, it’s a brother who is … he is also an addict. But he’s a dry drunk. So, yeah; you could surmise that. And I get along with them, to a degree. But he also … he can be … it’s like dealing with a child at times.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. Thank you for elaborating. Again, we’re going to have the same scale here about your family. So then, “I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\tAnd how many people would you say?\\nR:\\tUmm … I have a small family, so … I would say … three.\\nI:\\tOkay, and then, “I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.”\\nR:\\tUmm, two. [Inaudible 19:50] two. [Laugh]\\nI:\\tAnd is that an agree or a strongly agree?\\nR:\\tUmm, I would say strongly agree.\\nI:\\tOkay. “I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.”\\nR:\\tUmm … agree.\\nI:\\tAnd then it’s going to be the same; how many?\\nR:\\tTwo.\\nI:\\t“I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job.”\\nR:\\tI would say strongly agree, and I would say one. Well, advice that I would take. [Laugh] I would get a lot of advice, but the advice I would take would probably be from one of them.\\nI:\\tYes, okay; I can understand that. [Laugh] “I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem.”\\nR:\\tUmm, I would say--yeah, strongly agree. Two.\\nI:\\t“I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed.”\\nR:\\tThey’re not … I’m in California and they’re not. So, zero. Disagree.\\nI:\\tBut if you were in the same geographic area?\\nR:\\tOh, yeah. I would say strongly agree. I would say three. If [inaudible 21:30] we’re all [inaudible]. [Inaudible.] Yeah.\\nI:\\tAnd then, “I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support if needed.”\\nR:\\tUmm … I’m trying to think about this. Agree. I would probably say one.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. All right. So going on to a little bit more deeper into those, family and friends can have an important source of support, but they can also be an influence on us to do things that are may not in our best interests, or kind of--as you alluded to-- some of the bad apples can be just a source of stress. So can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends--both ones that you would consider a good, supportive relationship and then also one that you would consider bad, or destructive, or stressful?\\nR:\\tI don’t want to talk about that.\\nI:\\tOkay. That is more than fine. So then we’re moving to questions that are about relationships outside of your family. Can you think about three people to whom you feel closest personally, such as friends? And so again, this is outside of your family.\\nR:\\tThe one before was family?\\nI:\\tIt was family or friends.\\nR:\\tWell, with family I will answer that. That’s fine.\\nI:\\tOkay. \\nR:\\tHow long will it take?\\nI:\\tThis is open-ended. You’re the driver here.\\nR:\\tA good relationship, I’d say my mom and my sister. It’s more of … the relationship has evolved. They know everything about my addiction, as does my brother. But they are more calm, and grounded. I can turn to them for things. I don’t really ask a lot of advice, but I can be very candid with them about things in my life.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\tMy brother, we have some similarities. We’re both addicts. He’s been sober from drugs for a number of years, but he’s effectively a dry drunk [inaudible 24:02]. And that impacts the ability … you know, his emotional maturity is kind of stunted because of that. And it has impacted our relationship, you know? \\nI just started to establish boundaries, then, because … you know, some things he’s done I don’t agree with, and he doesn’t like it. [Inaudible 24:24], like training a dog. But it’s impacted. The boundaries are very helpful for me, and where I am in my recovery--that I just don’t [inaudible 24:35]. You know, whether he’s kind of abusive towards me, but if he’s talking negative about someone else in the family, I don’t want to hear it. \\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nI do not want to hear it. Not for nothing.\\nI:\\tSo it sounds like your mom and your sister are people that you feel like you can go to, to talk to. And your relationship with your brother is one that’s fine--but you’ve set up boundaries to kind of keep that relationship as … manageable.\\nR:\\tYeah, exactly. I would say that there’s a trust issue. I really don’t trust him. I don’t trust his intent on things. I think he has a good heart in there. When you’re an addictive mindset--the addiction not only … addition is not just the act of doing that behavior; it’s also the spirtual--or lack of spiritual--component in your life [inaudible]. So, any who.\\nI:\\tOne clarification question--and I apologize for my ignorance--but you’ve mentioned a few times; I think you’ve referred to your brother as a “dry drunk.” Can you explain what that means?\\nR:\\tYou never heard the term “dry drunk?” Do you have any alcoholics in your family?\\nI:\\tI do. \\nR:\\tSo dry drunk--this is a common terminology--is somebody who might not be doing the act of using drugs or alcohol, or whatever it is. But their emotional maturity is that of a child. It’s like walking on eggshells around them. \\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tThey behave … they might not be using. The addiction itself is about … the thing about it is the addiction itself is about the character defects and character flaws [inaudible 26:25] of doing it. Part of spiritual recovery is bringing a higher power--god--into your life. People who are dry drunks, they’re not doing that. They are the center of the universe. They control everything. It’s still very self-centered [inaudible 26:44]. The difference is that they not using drugs or alcohol [inaudible 26:49], right?\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay, thank you. Yeah, that makes sense in [inaudible 26:53] how you’re speaking to your relationship with your brother really makes sense in kind of filling that out as well. So, thank you for the clarification.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tSo we are going to start talking about relationships outside of your family. And it sounded like you weren’t comfortable with that. So I will--\\nR:\\t[Inaudible 27:15] We can just go for [inaudible].\\nI:\\tGreat. So how many friends--up to three, outside of your family--do you feel closest to?\\nR:\\tHow many?\\nI:\\tFrom zero to three, yeah.\\nR:\\tI would say four or five.\\nI:\\tAnd then we’re going to go through kind of-- If we could talk descriptively about three of your friends; not with names or anything. But if you have three friends in mind, for that third friend--is that friend a male or female?\\nR:\\tUmm, female.\\nI:\\tAnd then how would you describe her race or ethnicity?\\nR:\\tAsian.\\nI:\\tAnd then what is her age?\\nR:\\tUmm, mid-30s; mid, early 30s or something like that. And she is [inaudible 28:17] right now.\\nI:\\tAnd do you know what the highest level of education is that she has completed?\\nR:\\tUmm, four-year college I believe.\\nI:\\tAnd then do you know is she currently employed for pay?\\nR:\\tYeah. Very good job.\\nI:\\tI’m sorry; I cut you off--you were saying something about her education?\\nR:\\tShe might have a graduate degree. I’m not sure.\\nI:\\tOkay, and do you know if she is receiving any public aid?\\nR:\\tNo, she makes very good money.\\nI:\\tOkay. And is she married or living with a partner?\\nR:\\tNo. She’s single.\\nI:\\tAnd then the same set of questions for that second friend. Is it male or a female?\\nR:\\tI would say … I have probably seven, eight friends. But I don’t want to go through all of them.\\nI:\\tWe’re just going through three.\\nR:\\tThe second one would be a guy. The exact same thing; he supports himself. No public aid. Four-year college.\\nI:\\tOkay. And then what would you say is his age?\\nR:\\tUmm, early 40s?\\nI:\\tOkay. And then, again, race and ethnicity?\\nR:\\tWhite. \\nI:\\tAnd then is he married or living with a partner?\\nR:\\tSingle. Single. And then the third one would be retired, collecting pension. Maybe social security, I think. Married. \\nI:\\tAnd is that a male or female?\\nR:\\tMale, sorry. \\nI:\\tNo worries.\\nR:\\tCaucasian.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. Thank you. \\nI:\\tSo now we’re moving away from friends. I’m going to ask you some questions about groups and organizations you may be part of, and whether you receive support from those groups--either material or emotional.\\nR:\\tThis connection really sucks. It’s distracting.\\nI:\\tThank you for letting me know.\\n[Technical difficulties.]\\n[*end SF657, part 1 - begin SF657, part 2*] \\n[Note: timestamps restart at 00:00]\\nI:\\tIs this any better?\\nR:\\tNot really. But I don’t want to do this all night.\\nI:\\tOkay. At any point you can stop me and then we can schedule another time. Very weird.\\nR:\\tThere’s no intent behind it. It’s just the way it is. Anyway, let’s go.\\nI:\\tOkay. So we’re going to talk about some of your affiliations, and then talking about whether you feel like you’ve received emotional or material supports. So emotional support, you know--\\nR:\\tThere’s no material support. We can get that out of the way.\\nI:\\tSo then we can talk, I guess, just in terms of emotional supports. I’m going to walk through a few organizations and you’re going to let me know if you participate in them. So the first is church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious--\\nR:\\tNot in many, many years.\\nI:\\tOkay. Recreational club?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tSports team?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tMusic or artist group?\\nR:\\tUmm, no.\\nI:\\tCrew or a gang?\\nR:\\tWhat?\\nI:\\tLike, a crew or a gang?\\nR:\\t[Laugh] No gang affiliation for [inaudible 2:07]. \\nI:\\tAny local government group?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tCivic associations?\\nR:\\tThere’s no groups I belong to, except … just to make it easy for you. There’s no groups I belong to. The only thing I am part of is a 12-step program for my sex addiction.\\nI:\\tOkay, great. Thank you. And how often do you participate in this support group?\\nR:\\tWeekly I go to … I don’t call it a support group. It’s a 12 … well--\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tIt’s a 12-step program.\\nI:\\tIt’s a program. Okay.\\nR:\\tI don’t like the word “support.” If you put it under the category of recovery program, 12-step recovery program.\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tI go to meetings probably two to three times a week.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And so do you feel like you are able to turn to this group for emotional support?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tAnd you said not for financial support. \\nR:\\tCorrect.\\nI:\\tDo you feel comfortable elaborating about some of the emotional support you feel like you can receive from the group or have received in the past?\\nR:\\tUmm, yeah. They have an intimate relationship [inaudible 3:19] emotional [inaudible] talk about things that come up for me, being an addict. I mean, additionally, vice-versa; they’re people I can relate to because they have the same commonalities I do, which is … they’ve had an unmanageability around their sex addiction. So we share the commonality. A 12-step program is not a support group; it’s [inaudible 3:45].\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tIt’s a spiritual foundation, a process for recovery.\\nI:\\tOkay. And it sounds like what you’re saying is not only are you able to receive support from them, but since it’s a shared experience that you’re able to provide support as well. So it’s kind of a two-way [inaudible 4:05] relationship.\\nR:\\tCorrect. Right. I mean, the way a 12-step program works is you have the program, and then you have the fellowship. The program itself is kind of the framework of recovery; the 12 steps that you work through with a sponsor. And then the fellowship is kind of … basically the people inside it that you communicate with.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\t[Inaudible 4:28]. We [inaudible].\\nI:\\tOkay. Great, thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tSo we’re hopping around again. So a few questions about your employment history.\\nR:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. \\nI:\\tSo how old were you when you had your first job?\\nR:\\tUmm … first job … 14.\\nI:\\tAnd how much of your adult life would you you’ve been employed–all, most--\\nR:\\tAll. I was unemployed for brief periods of time. Very short periods of time. But yeah, I’ve been employed my whole time. \\nI:\\tAnd can you just briefly describe what skills you bring to the labor market, and how you?\\nR:\\tI mean, I’m in sales, and--\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tAnd in sales, the essence of that is going to be communication. \\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\tHow did I learn that? Just from … I’m a social person. I mean, I’m a social person. I think it’s interpersonal skills, and … you know, things come in ebbs and flows in terms of [inaudible 5:44]. \\nI:\\tAnd are there other skills that you’re--for your current job, I guess, or maybe future that you are trying to learn now or that you’re hoping to learn in the future?\\nR:\\tNot particularly. I mean, you know what? Possibly. I do photography on the side.\\nI:\\tOh, cool.\\nR:\\tAnd eventually-- Oh, that’s my passion. I [inaudible 6:07] connect to art galleries. If I could eventually monetize that, I would do that in a heartbeat.\\nI:\\tYeah.\\nR:\\tBut I’m not going to hold my breath. If I had somebody who is connected who could make introductions for me, I would. But I just need to put together a portfolio. So I would say that skill, in terms of that would be a skill--learning how to continue to do things with photography. I’m very creative, but I can always get better in what I do. So a skillset in terms of outside of what I do on a day-in, day-out basis.\\nI:\\tThat’s really cool. I would imagine that this … The friends I have in the sales world, it’s very intense and can be stressful. So I imagine having a creative outlet is a nice balance to that, to your nine-to-five day.\\nR:\\tYeah. I’m passionate about health and fitness. I work out a lot. And I’m also passionate about photography. I have a regular camera with very nice lenses, but I do most of my pictures candidly, during the day or during the week. Or on my phone. I have the iPhone 7 Plus, which is awesome.\\nI:\\tI’ve heard that that’s pretty amazing. That’s cool. That’s awesome. I wish you the best of luck with that.\\nR:\\tThanks. I appreciate it.\\nI:\\tI’m going to walk you through a few possible barriers to employment and just ask you to tell me if any of these have ever occurred; if you’ve ever faced any of these in terms of barriers to employment. The first is education, training, or experience?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tTransportation?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tFamilial obligations?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tLack of available jobs?\\nR:\\tUmm, when I’ve been laid off … yeah. I mean, I wasn’t laid off for long, but available jobs that I liked. [Laugh] There is a bit of a caveat to that.\\nI:\\tSo available jobs that were in your interest area and where your skills are. That makes sense. Employer discrimination?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tCriminal record?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tSubstance abuse?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tDomestic violence?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tMental and/or physical health?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tHomeless/housing instability?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tAny others that I didn’t cover?\\nR:\\tNo. But I would say that I did lose a job indirectly because--two jobs. I believe, indirectly, because of my addiction. So I don’t know if that would classify in any of your categories. Not directly, but more indirectly. Indirectly. Not directly.\\nI:\\tDo you feel comfortable elaborating on what you mean by indirect?\\nR:\\tWhen I lived in Boston, I was in my addiction--before I really started working the program. I was just angry. I would stay up late. While I wasn’t using a physical substance, the sex addiction--the chemicals in your body. I acted like a child. Eventually I got fired, because I just blew up at somebody. And I would say that the other one, I was … you know, I think I wasn’t as productive as I could have been because I was in my addiction, frankly. So I think that would be accurate.\\nI:\\tThe addiction is affecting how you perform at work.\\nR:\\tIt did.\\nI:\\tAnd work performance is kind of what determines if you’re keeping a job or not. Yeah, I think that that’s pretty--\\nR:\\tI’m not saying that the results would have been different, but I think I would have had better results had I not been in the addiction.\\nI:\\tGreat. Thank you for sharing. And you said you work in sales. Do you have just one job?\\nR:\\tI have one.\\nI:\\tAre then are you comfortable sharing what your current job title is?\\nR:\\tVice-president. It’s a generally baseless[?] title.\\nI:\\tAnd then when did you begin that job?\\nR:\\tMy existing?\\nI:\\tYes.\\nR:\\tMy existing … existing job I started in 2012.\\nI:\\tI assume that it’s full-time?\\nR:\\tCorrect.\\nI:\\tAnd then did you find this job? \\nR:\\tReferral. Referral through a former colleague. Through LinkedIn. It was from a former colleague. He got it through LinkedIn.\\nI:\\tAnd you already said that you earn about $300,000 a year.\\nR:\\tIn that ballpark.\\nI:\\tWe’ve already answered these questions. I’m going to skip ahead. Is the job that you currently have now--is that typical of what you’ve been doing in the past? Have you been working in sales previously at this high a level?\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tCan you just give me a general overview of the types of jobs you’ve had, and your experience in the job market--and the type of work you’ve done prior to this job?\\nR:\\tI’ve had other sales jobs. I mean, I started off in service when I graduated from college. I’ve had jobs for a long time, for the most part.\\nI:\\tYes; since 14 I believe you said.\\nR:\\tYeah. But I would say after college I’ve had jobs for a long time. One company I was at for I think four years. The next one I was at for three. The next one for eleven. And then this one. I mean, there really haven’t been many.\\nI:\\tIt sounds like you keep, I feel like. That’s not the generational thing everyone has; 11 years, that’s great. You don’t hear that as much these days.\\nR:\\tDepending on the field you work in and the industry. I mean, tech--these people don’t stay as long, probably. In perpetuity.\\nI:\\tCan you tell me about what you would consider your most positive work experience, and what made that experience so positive?\\nR:\\tMy most positive work experience was when I … the job before this. Well, the same company, but initially when I got to the company, for several years it was a start-up within a big company. And it was a product that was incredibly innovative. It was amazing. It basically became a Harvard case study.\\nI:\\tThat’s cool. Wow.\\nR:\\tIt was pretty amazing.\\nI:\\tThat’s amazing, to be a part of that.\\nR:\\tAbsolutely. I completely agree.\\nI:\\tThat’s really cool. And on the flip side, can you tell me about your most negative work experience?\\nR:\\tYeah. I’m trying to think. My most negative one I think was doing customer service. I got very burnt out doing it. That’s also when I got fired. I was unhappy doing it. I had done it for too long.\\nI:\\tYou referred to that job earlier as well in the interview. Correct?\\nR:\\tYeah.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else you want to add about your work?\\nR:\\tNot really. I travel. My last two jobs--two, three--I’ve traveled with them. I traveled, which can be exhausting. Being exhausted is for many addicts what is called a trigger. That puts you at a place of being in discomfort, and we’re looking for comfort. I need to be in a spiritually grounded place, and get rest when I’m like that.\\nI:\\tYou said your previous jobs involved a lot of travel. Does that mean you’re not traveling as frequently with your current job?\\nR:\\tI’m choosing not to. I really don’t need to do that as much. Although just recently I just made the decision [inaudible 15:54] business where I’m at right now, and from a sanity standpoint.\\nI:\\tThat’s good. Great. Now we’re moving on about asking you questions about experiences you’ve had with substance abuse, if any.\\nR:\\tNone. None.\\nI:\\tThat’s what I thought. So let me skip those. And now I’m going to ask you some questions about your mental and/or emotional health. Again, these are all going to be kept private. You don’t have to answer anything that you’re not comfortable with.\\nR:\\tSounds good.\\nI:\\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professional that you have a mental or emotional condition or that you show symptoms of a mental or emotional condition?\\nR:\\tNo. Not outside of my addiction. No.\\nI:\\tIs your addiction diagnosed by a professional?\\nR:\\tOh, yeah.\\nI:\\tWhat was your diagnosis?\\nR:\\tSex addiction.\\nI:\\tSo in addition to that addiction, have you ever yourself thought you’ve had an emotional or a mental health condition that was not diagnosed?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tHave you ever taken medicine prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of an emotional or mental condition?\\nR:\\tSorry. I’m munching on food.\\nI:\\tNo, you’re fine.\\nR:\\tYes. Here’s the thing. The only condition I had, I still have. I was diagnosed when I was probably 14 or 15 with Tourette’s. My psychologist [says?] that impacts my addiction. It’s part of Tourette’s impulsivity. \\nFor me, I did take medication for it until four or five years ago. It just made me tired. And the Tourette’s has lessened as I’ve gotten older. I also took medication for depression [and for?] ADD. I stopped taking it altogether, because I don’t really think I had those conditions. I think it was more … I mean, maybe I have borderline ADD. But the side effects of all these things was … it wasn’t worth the … Drug companies love you to take them, right? So they don’t legalize marijuana.\\nBy the way, on a side note, I don’t smoke weed. But drug companies and alcohol companies are the ones, basically, who are against legalizing marijuana because it takes money away from them. That’s a side note. I don’t smoke. Anyway. People who are using that, they’re not going to be taking stuff for depression. Go figure.\\nI:\\tThat’s interesting, and not something that’s in the discourse that’s around legalization at all.\\nR:\\tIf you do a Google for it, maybe you’ll find the drug companies or the amount of drug sales that have fallen in states that have legalized marijuana.\\nI:\\tThat’s super-interesting. I’m definitely going to look into that. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tThen, the next question is have you ever been admitted to a mental hospital, unit, or treatment program where you’ve stayed overnight because of an emotional or mental condition?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tThen have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional?\\nR:\\tYes. I see a psychologist now.\\nI:\\tIs that a helpful--\\nR:\\tVery helpful. Very helpful. I get more out of it in the space that I’m in now. Being in the addiction itself, it’s somewhat helpful--but you get more out of it when you’re present and not in an unconscious state, as Eckhart Tolle would say. So when I’m present I get a lot more out of everything that I do.\\nI:\\tDid you self-elect to go to counseling? Or is this court-ordered, or required under your program?\\nR:\\tSelf-elected. Self-elected.\\nI:\\tHow long have you been in therapy?\\nR:\\tA long time. A long, long time. I mean, since I was a kid.\\nI:\\tThe next question, it says do you feel like you have an emotional or mental health condition now? And so you’ve talked about your addiction. Is there anything else?\\nR:\\tNo. I [inaudible 21:17] it anymore. I think you have some insanity when you’re in your addiction, candidly.\\nI:\\tCan you talk a little bit about how you’ve seen your emotional or mental concerns change over the years? You talked a little bit about your Tourette’s and your medication. Is there any other change you’ve seen over the course of your life?\\nR:\\tI grew up also with a learning disability, too. I’d put that in there as well. I would just say that I think over the course of time I’ve adjusted to having a learning disability, I have learning comprehension. So I probably have to slow down and just stop and read and take notes. I’m a visual person in many ways. That’s what I’d say.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else on the topic of mental and emotional health you want to add or talk more about?\\nR:\\tNot really. The other thing is from a physical standpoint just … I’m not sure if we’re going to get to it. I had testicular cancer 17 years ago.\\nI:\\tI’m sorry to hear that.\\nR:\\tNo, it’s fine.\\nI:\\tWow. I’m sure that was very difficult.\\nR:\\tIt was not easy. Looking back on it, I think I was going through denial that pertained to myself. But it was a lot. When I look back on it. It was a traumatic experience.\\nI:\\tYeah. Wow. Are you in remission now?\\nR:\\tYeah. Now I’m cured; 17 years ago.\\nI:\\tThat’s good. That must have been very difficult to deal with.\\nR:\\tIt was not easy. No.\\nI:\\tThen we’re going to move to the next section, which is we’re going to talk about experiences with the criminal justice system. And first, with starting about learning more about interactions that you may have had with the police. As with some of the others, again, these are sensitive and emotional and you’re not required to answer anything. Please stop me at any point.\\nR:\\tBefore you do that, I’ll let you know that through the grace of something bigger than me, I went through first-time offenders program twice. So I was arrested twice over I think 12 years between the two things; 11 or 12 years between the two things. The courts allowed me to go through it a second time.\\nI:\\tYou were an adult at both of those arrests?\\nR:\\tYeah.\\nI:\\tOr was one you were a juvenile?\\nR:\\tNo. Adult.\\nI:\\tWhat were the specific offenses for which you were arrested?\\nR:\\tSolicitation.\\nI:\\tBoth times. Correct?\\nR:\\tYeah. Correct.\\nI:\\tAnd then how old were you at the time of your first arrest?\\nR:\\tI was 31 or 32. The second one would be 44, 45. Something like that.\\nI:\\tAnd then can you describe for me the event of your arrest, from the moment you were approached by officers, and then taken into custody--and then walking through arraignment, assuming you were arraigned.\\nR:\\tNo. I was never. Are you smoking a cigarette, by the way?\\nI:\\tYeah.\\nR:\\tI can tell.\\nI:\\tOh, you asked if I was. Oh, no. I’m not.\\nR:\\tYou’re not? It sounded like you were. Never mind.\\nI:\\tI thought you were asking my permission. I was like, “Sure.”\\nR:\\tNo, no. I don’t smoke. I have very sensitive hearing, so I pick up everything. Sorry. I’m quirky like that. \\nThere were two times I was arrested. The first time, I was soliciting somebody on the street, whatever. Yeah. I was soliciting someone. Then I was handcuffed. I was handcuffed and walked down to … It was a sting operation. Both of these situations were sting operations. I had walked to a parking lot. They told me about most likely going to a first-time offenders program. This was back in 2011 or 2012. One of the two. \\nAnd then, the second time … and the police were fair both times. They were not abusive in any way, shape, or form. I was in my program to begin with at the time. This was in relapse.\\nI was never arraigned. There was no arraignment. I could either contest it--which I would have gone to court--or I would have the charges dropped if I went to the first-time offenders program, which I went through twice. \\nAnd the first time was soliciting someone in the street. The second one was going to a hotel after contacting someone through Backpage[?]. They’re no longer doing their ads anymore. But contacting people that way. [Inaudible 26:46] sting operation in the hotel room and I was just … Yeah. That’s what happened.\\nI:\\tYou said that the police treated you fairly.\\nR:\\tYes.\\nI:\\tJust give me what makes you feel like they treated you fairly? If you can describe that.\\nR:\\tThe first time, I can’t really remember. But they weren’t going, “You fucking idiot.” They were not abusive. Second time, I was distraught. I was just I fucked up; I am so sorry.\\nThis was where I was at. And I broke down. And they were just like--no, it’ll be okay. Don’t worry. There are worse things you could have done. So they were somewhat empathetic. Not empathetic, but … I mean, I still broke the law, of course.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. So were you taken into custody? Were you held in jail?\\nR:\\tNo. No. No. Not this time.\\nI:\\tSo you were not booked. So they released you after taking you into custody, but never booking you.\\nR:\\tRight. The charges were dropped. Arrest, but no charges.\\nI:\\tThen, sorry, to confirm, you’ve never actually been convicted?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tBecause of the court diversion program.\\nR:\\tThey were showing as arrests. I had an attorney change them to detainments. Now it’s detainments. And then there are a couple things I’m doing, and then he’s going to get the record sealed. We’re working to try to get the record sealed.\\nI:\\tThere may be a question about this later, too, but did you have a private lawyer or did you have a public defender?\\nR:\\tPrivate.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else you want to say about that? About your arrests?\\nR:\\tNo. There’s not much to say about it. They were fair. I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to go through the first-time offenders program, rather than just being booked. If it happened in any other place, a lot of other places I wouldn’t have been as fortunate. Also, the fact that I was able to go through the first-time offenders program twice. I was extremely fortunate.\\nI:\\tThose were both in San Francisco?\\nR:\\tCorrect.\\nI:\\tAnd just in terms of … they released you upon the kind of everything is dropped based on the assumption that you go through and complete the program? That if something--\\nR:\\tYou have to complete the program. And then that’s when officially the charges are dropped, basically. The second time I also had to go to the community thing, and basically sit down with people from the community and write out the impact that my addiction has on the community and [inaudible 29:59].\\nI:\\tCan you explain what is the “community” that you were … can you explain a little bit more about what that process was like?\\nR:\\tThe community was just people who happened to live in a certain area. They basically got together. It was more formalized than the first time I went through it. The first time, there was not [inaudible 30:22].\\nBut then this time it was kind of a community; just people who lived in the neighborhood or they volunteered. They talked about the impact of this and they wanted me to write something about the impact of prostitution and trafficking. In other words, writing a report on what I’ve learned about the impact of prostitution on everybody.\\nI:\\tHow was that experience for you?\\nR:\\tIt was good. I think it’s important to go through, candidly.\\nI:\\tWhy? Can you explain a little bit on why you think it’s important?\\nR:\\tWell, I think it’s important to recognize the impact our addiction has on people.\\nI:\\tGreat. That’s helpful. Thank you. So, the same as with law enforcement. I’m going to ask you some questions … I am going to read you some statements and ask you to describe how you may feel about legal authorities. And so again, this is going to be the scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. “I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.”\\nR:\\tImpacting me or impacting everybody else? What’s the context?\\nI:\\tIt’s up to your interpretation. I read this, “I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.”\\nR:\\tI, personally.\\nI:\\tPersonally. Yeah.\\nR:\\tWell, only as it pertains to me, I would say most of the time--yes. From my experience, yes. I do. That’s just my experience. But I think legal authorities make mistakes. Absolutely. Because they’re human beings. They’re going to make mistakes.\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And so for you, personally, you said maybe somewhat agree? Or strongly agree?\\nR:\\tSomewhat agree.\\nI:\\tThen, if you’re talking about the broader global context, it would maybe be--\\nR:\\tFor me, it would be strongly agree. And the global context, agree.\\nI:\\tOkay. “People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“It is difficult to break the law and keep one’s self-respect.”\\nR:\\tCompletely agree. Totally agree. Whatever that falls into. Sorry.\\nI:\\tCan you elaborate a little bit there?\\nR:\\tYou’ve just got to do what’s right. What I mean by that is if you’re doing something that violates your basic … How can you feel good about yourself--unless you really compartmentalize things--if you do things that go against a true self[?]? It’s going to … I can speak for myself. It impacts my self-esteem and how I feel about myself.\\nI:\\tI understand that. “The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me.”\\nR:\\tPeople in power. Yeah. Strongly agree.\\nI:\\t“People in power use the law to control people like me.”\\nR:\\tAgree.\\nI:\\tSomewhat agree or strongly agree?\\nR:\\tSomewhat agree.\\nI:\\t“The law does not protect my interests.”\\nR:\\tDisagree.\\nI:\\tStrongly or somewhat?\\nR:\\tSomewhat.\\nI:\\t“Most police in my city do their job well.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“Most police in my city treat people with respect.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“The basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police.”\\nR:\\tStrongly agree.\\nI:\\t“The police in my city have too much power.”\\nR:\\tStrongly disagree.\\nI:\\tAnd, “most police in my city treat some people better than others.”\\nR:\\tI don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say to that. I would say … I don’t know what to say to that. It would be incorrect for me to … And I think for all the police … I’m just doing it based on my own inherent knowledge or bias.\\nI:\\tI can put you down for neither agree nor disagree.\\nR:\\tCool.\\nI:\\tCool. It seems like overall of kind of positive feelings, at least in your personal experience, about law enforcement and the way that they both conduct themselves and their governing. And how they’re operated. But then you also expressed some concerns about power; the people in power dictate what the laws are, which may, from what I would infer from what you said, may sometimes be in line with your values but maybe sometimes may not. Is that the correct summation of your answering?\\nR:\\tI think that’s fair to say.\\nI:\\tGreat. Have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questions, physically threatened, abused, or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tI’m not turning my pages as fast. To what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with the police?\\nR:\\tWhat do you mean? Should I say “agree,” “strongly disagree”?\\nI:\\tNo. It’s just open-ended. To what extent, and how? Then if you can explain how you think race has affected your interactions with the police.\\nR:\\tI’m white, so I don’t think it’s impacted me at all. I don’t have probably the inherent biases a lot of people would, based on my own experiences per se.\\nI:\\tYou said you don’t have inherent biases? Or the police don’t have inherent biases towards you? Which--?\\nR:\\tI think they don’t have inherent biases towards me if they’re white. I would say that, yeah. That’s what I would say. How much longer do we have, by the way? I’m getting really tired.\\nI:\\tWe still have a decent amount of questions.\\nR:\\tI’m not going to be able to get through the whole of this.\\nI:\\tOkay.\\nR:\\tI can give you another ten minutes.\\nI:\\tUnderstandable. Let’s just move on. You were not detained pretrial.\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tThat is correct. Actually, we can skip a bunch of those. Sorry. I’m just trying to move through. So was your diversion program considered neighborhood court?\\nR:\\tYes. Yes. Yes. The second time.\\nI:\\tHow long is the neighborhood court program that you were in?\\nR:\\tA month. How long? I went and met once. I talked to them. Then I came back and I read the paper to them. That was it.\\nI:\\tThen, following your arrest, how did you support yourself financially?\\nR:\\tI still had a job.\\nI:\\tI want to ask you a bit about access to programs or services that you maybe had after your arrest and whether you found them helpful.\\nR:\\tThe only one I used was my program. That’s it. That’s the only program. I don’t want to be wasting your time. It’s the only program.\\nI:\\tIs there anything else you wish you had had in terms of access to services, or other things in addition to your program, post-arrest?\\nR:\\tUmm … The only other thing might be to … understanding about … I think the only [thing] is understanding about getting charges reduced or getting them eliminated. It was kind of gray. Getting things expunged. They talked about that very broadly, but I think it was not very clear.\\nI:\\tI was going to say, so kind of, because you were talking about going through the expungement process--and it sounds like most of that you’re doing on your own.\\nR:\\tRight. Mine is not going to be expunged. It’s going to become sealed. I don’t know what that’s called, when it’s sealed.\\nI:\\tBut that was not something that was covered. And also, post-arrest, can you tell me about your initial interactions with your family members?\\nR:\\tThey didn’t know about it.\\nI:\\tOkay, so it hasn’t affected your relationship with your family, since they didn’t know.\\nR:\\tRight.\\nI:\\tAlso, I guess, the same with friends. Were there friends that knew? And did this effect your relationship with friends?\\nR:\\tThe only people that knew were people in my program, and it did not impact it.\\nI:\\tYou do not have children. And it sounds like you were living in your same house and apartment.\\nR:\\tYeah.\\nI:\\tYour housing situation did not change.\\nR:\\tRight.\\nI:\\tI can skip through all of these housing. I guess maybe, I know since you only have a few minutes, can you just broadly talk about how you feel about your neighborhood that you live in? Is it a safe place to live?\\nR:\\tExtremely safe.\\nI:\\tDo you feel like it’s ... Is it hard to stay out of trouble in your neighborhood?\\nR:\\tHere’s the thing; I can get into trouble anywhere. So it’s not the neighborhood. I would say that your spiritual state is what impacts the quality of your sobriety. Neighborhood is immaterial. I would say if I lived in Tenderloin … I live in the Marina. But in the Tenderloin it might be a little different. But I would say in my existing spiritual state I’m not … I haven’t had thoughts of wanting to medicate with sex in over two months.\\nI:\\tOkay. Then I want to ask you a few questions. Again, you’re in power here; tell me when you’re done. About your experience in neighborhood court from the moment you entered the courtroom until you were dismissed.\\nR:\\tI never went to a courtroom. We can skip those. There’s no courtroom. No court.\\nI:\\tThat community program that you explained is basically you were--\\nR:\\tIt wasn’t a court. It was in lieu of court. I never went to court.\\nI:\\tYou walked me through what the proceedings were like. It was members of the community. How it made you feel.\\nR:\\tExactly. Yeah.\\nI:\\tGreat. Was there any supervision component of neighborhood court?\\nR:\\tNo. I don’t think so.\\nI:\\tSo you weren’t reporting to anyone while you were going through the process. It was more just making sure you would show up.\\nR:\\tThey were reporting whether I showed up or not.\\nI:\\tIs there any [inaudible 44:07]? I know you talked about you thought it was important to share here how--\\nR:\\tThey sent me. They suggested I do this. That was [inaudible busted me.\\nI:\\tIn terms of if there’s any other benefits from the program, from participating? I know you spoke about talking about this and hearing from the community members. Any personal relationship? I’m guessing not education or employment, but any other benefits?\\nR:\\tNo. No. No, no, no.\\nI:\\tWere there any negative consequences associated with your participation?\\nR:\\tNo. None. None.\\nI:\\tThen, can you tell me a little bit about the program, the other program for first offense? Did you get to know anyone as a result of being in the program?\\nR:\\tThere was not a program. It wasn’t a … I didn’t meet any other people who were arrested. I did not meet anybody else in the program. People who were in the first-time offenders program, I didn’t talk to anybody.\\nI:\\tYou did not talk to anybody?\\nR:\\tNo.\\nI:\\tIs there anything you can say about staff of either the first-time offenders or the neighborhood court that you interacted with most? Were you actually interacting with staff as part of that?\\nR:\\tMinimally.\\nI:\\tIt doesn’t sound like anyone influenced your participation.\\nR:\\tNo. No.\\nI:\\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program?\\nR:\\tIt was uncomfortable. I don’t want to say it was difficult. It was just uncomfortable.\\nI:\\tCan you explain a little bit?\\nR:\\tBecause of the degree of shame. You’re there for a reason. You violated the law, so I think there’s a degree of probably shame that comes up.\\nI:\\tWere you ever accused of violating the conditions of the program?\\nR:\\tNo. No. No. No. Nope.\\nI:\\tI think you said earlier, but completion of the program was … You completed the program successfully, which was determined by completing that community meeting. Is that correct?\\nR:\\tYeah. Plus going to the first-time offenders program. There were two parts of it.\\nI:\\tHow did they notify you that you were done? Did you get anything formal?\\nR:\\tWhen you went through everything, you just got a little note saying I basically completed bla-bla-bla.\\nI:\\tThe charges were dismissed but the arrest was still on your record.\\nR:\\tIt was changed to a detainment, because of me getting an attorney.\\nI:\\tOkay. There are just maybe two or three more very quick ones. To what extent do you agree with the following? “Overall, the program was very helpful.”\\nR:\\tAgree.\\nI:\\tJust agree, not strongly agree?\\nR:\\tI would say strongly agree, just for shits and giggles.\\nI:\\t[laugh] And is there something that you can say in addition to what you said already about why you felt it was particularly helpful? Or if there was any particularly unhelpful or counterproductive parts?\\nR:\\tNone of this stuff got me sober. This program, if you’re not an addict, it might help you. If you’re an addict, maybe it helps you. It’s helpful in the extent as understanding the impact that our actions have on the community. It’s helpful to understand that. What I would say is, if someone is in denial about it, they’re probably going to think it’s horrible. For me, I realized exactly what I did. I know that I fucked up. That didn’t get me sober, in either case. It’s been a long, painful path for me to get to where I’ve got to.\\nI:\\tFrom what you’ve talked about from the group you’re in, and I forget the term that you used, the 12-step group, but that’s where you’ve gotten most of your support, as opposed to the neighborhood court program.\\nR:\\tWell, I mean it’s helpful information. I think I understand what they’re trying to do. And I’m glad they do it, because some people will do that and never get arrested again. Not only get arrested; but they’ll never do the activity again. I believe that a lot of people who do it are addicts and probably don’t stop doing it unless they … That’s my belief [inaudible 49:09]. Unless they get to a place where they’re ready to work a program as a spiritual recovery. For me, personally, I’m actually … it’s kind of coincidental you called today. Tomorrow I’m actually participating in the program. I’m actually speaking.\\nI:\\tGreat.\\nR:\\tTo my program. We have people come in there, and speak about [inaudible 49:36] and what we’ve been through. And that’s what I’m doing, and talking about our program as well from a different perspective than I experienced before. I’m grateful I had the opportunity to do that [inaudible 49:51]. And 99 percent of the people either A; are an addict, or, B; are not ready yet if they are. You know?\\nI would say most people … I believe, most people who pay for sex, it’s not a one-time thing. Although I could be wrong. But I would say 99 percent of the people are not ready to recover if they are addicts. And then hopefully [inaudible 50:18]. That’s it.\\nI:\\tI think the ten minutes is probably up. Is there anything else that you didn’t have the chance to say that you think is important to make sure you convey?\\nR:\\tWhat else do you need to know? Let me just ask you. If you could summarize other things without going through every question, what else do you need to know?\\nI:\\tThis is my very first interview, so I’m not as familiar with the docket, so I can’t run through it as quickly. I apologize. Were there any challenges? Anything specific about the program that you think either set you up for success, set you up for failure? From staffing, from the process itself, and if there are just other things that, in terms of your experience going through this program, how that kind of affected you in your life today.\\nR:\\tWell, I had it probably … a little different for me than probably other people, because I knew I was a sex addict when I was arrested both times. It was not a surprise to me. I would say that because … I thought it was very good talking, talking about the impact that it has on people in society. I think it’s very important doing that. I believe that. That’s me, personally. It was good knowledge for me. It was. I won’t say it wasn’t. It was. Now, did I know all that stuff? No. I didn’t. Did that help get me sober? No. Because I’m an addict. So I had to hit my bottom before I got to a place of where I’m at now. So you know, it’s been my addiction. I’ll just be very candid with you. My addiction was paying for sex from … Then, when I got arrested the first time, I’m like--I’m never going to solicit anyone on the street again. I’m just going to use Backpage or whatever. No problem.\\nI’m just going to tell you my quick story, just so you understand. I’ve been through a lot with my life and my addiction. My addiction led to me going to a hotel and getting beaten up by a pimp, in addition to getting arrested twice. Then going to--okay. I’m not going to go to a hotel. I’m going to have people come to me. So I wasn’t getting arrested. I got beaten up by a pimp. I got robbed at the same time. It’s the nature of the addiction. It takes you a lot of places. Not some places, but places nonetheless. \\nThen I would say that I went to a place the last couple years where I’m not using the newspapers but then going to sugar daddy websites. Which was the same thing. It was manipulating young women who were in college who had, because of college, who had a lot of debt. Basically do what I wanted. Lying to them, telling them that I wanted something ongoing when I didn’t. Having them believing and feeling that it wasn’t transactional, but [inaudible 54:01] transactional. I would have unprotected sex with a lot of women. I’d give them a lot of money. I was [inaudible 54:05] them. \\nFor me, ultimately, that was my bottom. I felt so [inaudible 54:10] about myself and everything that I was doing, manipulating. For me, it didn’t feel … I was like, it’s different than Backpages; these aren’t really full-time prostitutes.\\nNo, they weren’t. These are people basically who probably were, I imagine, were abused probably sometime in their life. Any woman who turns to selling their body probably has been abused some time in their life. That’s what happens.\\nMaybe they have never been sexually abused, but they’ve had some sort of abuse. They have to, to get to this point. There has to be some sort of self-esteem … People don’t [inaudible 54:52] really high self-esteem, who sell their body. \\nThat was my bottom, which I needed to hit. I eventually got to finally a place of really seeing the impact it had on these women. I’m sure it had on other people, but especially for the women who are not full-time prostitutes. But it’s still prostitution. I’m still paying for something. I was getting something. [Inaudible 55:19]. Anyway. That wasn’t part of the thing, but I just wanted to add context to how I got to where I got to today.\\nI:\\tThank you. I really appreciate you sharing that. I know it probably can be difficult to share. But I do appreciate it. The last thing is just if there’s any feedback you have--either for me; I guess questions, one, if there’s any feedback you have in terms of what we talked about today. They’re obviously sensitive, and can be sensitive and uncomfortable. Do you have any suggestions for how we might ask these questions more effectively? Or just make the process better? We welcome any feedback you have.\\nR:\\tI would say for you, it’s your first time going through it, which I understand. Group the questions together. Ad that you need to kind of say … framing it out and saying, “I have eight sets of questions. These are what they deal with.” Frame it out. I’m a control freak, so it helps me to know how many sets of questions you have.\\nI:\\tThat makes sense.\\nR:\\tThe other thing is, understand, especially if they’re not “agree, strongly, agree,” if they’re freeform, is understanding what the questions are. You could ask me; hey, this one is dealing with this--tell me about these kinds of things.\\nI:\\tOkay. Thank you. That’s super-helpful. And I appreciate your patience. I know it is a long interview, and it is my first time. I really appreciate your patience.\\nR:\\tYou got me on a good day. I’m an inpatient person. You got me on a good day. I’m just tired. I get grumpy when I get tired.\\nI:\\tIt’s Friday. It’s Friday. I understand. The last thing is that we are required to ask is, to help us get in touch with you about any questions, we also like to see if you’re willing to provide information on family members and friends if we can’t get in touch with you?\\nR:\\tNo. Absolutely not.\\nI:\\tOkay. Thank you very much, [Name], for your time. I really appreciate it.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome.\\nI:\\tI really, really do appreciate it. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re welcome. As I said, I want that money donated to the San Francisco SafeHouse.\\nI:\\tYes. I have that noted.\\nR:\\tOkay. Good. Excellent.\\nI:\\tI will follow up about the letter.\\nR:\\tI appreciate it. It’d be helpful. I’m not asking for money, but I’m asking for a letter that says I was helpful that I participated in the survey. Because obviously, this helps the court diversion program, ultimately.\\nI:\\tI guess just in terms of structure, is it a “To whom this may concern: [Name] participated in this X, Y, and Z. He was helpful.” Done, and signed by the head researcher? Or is there someone more specific?\\nR:\\tDo something so you have the research ... “This information is used for,” blank, blank, blank. So they know that I participated in it, and also the purpose of it. That would be helpful. Because what’s going to happen is my attorney is going to go, “What have you done? What do we need to tell the court?” [Inaudible 58:37] number one, hopefully by the time I do this I’m sponsoring other people. I’m speaking on a regular basis at the first-time offenders program, speaking. Not participating, I’m just speaking. And then also participating in this survey. I’m continuing to work at program with recovery.\\nI:\\tI don’t foresee there being a problem with that, but if there is, is it okay if I call you back if we have any questions about that letter?\\nR:\\tYeah. Absolutely. Please do.\\nI:\\tIf you don’t hear from me, it’ll be in the mail. Yes.\\nR:\\tThanks so much. I appreciate it. Once again, the only thing is that if you block your number from me, I might not answer the call. You can easily get a Google Voice number or something.\\nI:\\tThat’s helpful.\\nR:\\tBecause I knew your name, and you don’t want people to know your name.\\nI:\\tThat’s good advice. Thank you.\\nR:\\tI’m in recovery. Some people you’re going to call are not in recovery.\\nI:\\tRight. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou might want to tell people, going forward, that might be … It’s a suggestion. Not just for you, but for other people. Anyway. My two cents.\\nI:\\tWait, sorry. Say that last part again. You might want to what?\\nR:\\tYou might want to let them know, other people, other people who are doing this as well. Like yourself. You’re in grad school, taking psychology for grad school, right?\\nI:\\tHmm-hmm [yes].\\nR:\\tIt’s important you guys protect yourselves. That would be my feedback.\\nI:\\tThat’s really good. I will definitely make sure that other folks are taking that advice as well. Thank you.\\nR:\\tYou’re quite welcome. You’re quite welcome. Anyway. Anything else for today?\\nI:\\tNo. I hope your presentation--your talk--at the program goes well tomorrow.\\nR:\\tThanks so much.\\nI:\\tThank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it. Have a good weekend.\\nR:\\tMy pleasure. You too. Take care.\\nI:\\tOkay. Thanks, Jeff.\\nR:\\tBye-bye.\\nI:\\tBye.\\n[End of SF657, part two.]\\nEND OF TRANSCRIPT\\n\\nSF657\\t\\tPage 1\\n\\n\\n'"

      " I:\tGood afternoon, [Name]. So I just want to remind you that if there are any questions that I ask that you dont feel comfortable answeringjust know that you can say pass; I dont feel comfortable answering that. If at any point you want to stop the interview, you have the right to stop the interview whenever youre ready. And if you have any questions for meif you want me to clarify something, whatever it isjust let me know. And then we can deal with that. R:\tOkay. I:\tAnd also, I just want you to remember that throughout this process this is your story. So you tell me what happened to you. I want to hear what your experiences have been like, and I want to hear it from your voice. So just keep that in mind throughout. So first Im going to ask you several sets of questions having to do with your background, your relationships, and your experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. Okay? R:\tOkay. I:\tSo Im going to start with questions about your background. First is how old are you? I think you told me 23? R:\tYeah, 23. I:\tAnd when were you born? R:\tMay 13, 93. I:\tWhat does that make you, a Taurus? R:\tYeah.  I:\tAnd where were you born?  R:San Francisco.  I:\tAnd in terms of race and ethnicity, what do you consider yourself? R:Black. I:\tI have to ask. R:\tI know. I:\tAnd in terms of how people perceive you, do they also perceive you as black?  R:\tYeah, of course. I:\tWhats your present marital status? Married R:Im not married. Im in a relationship. I:\tSo its basically single, never married  unless you want to call her a partner? And youre living with her? Or him. Im sorry; I make assumptions. R:\tI am living with her, yeah. We live together. I:\tOkay. So Im going to put living with a partner, then. R:\tOkay.  I:\tForgive me, I made an assumption.  R:\tNo problem. I:\tHow many children do you have? R:\tNone. I:\tWhat is your highest level of education?  R:\tI graduated high school. But I did a semester of college while [inaudible 2:40]. I:\tOkay, so some college Ill put. And did you receive any help in school with regards to academics? Like tutoring, extra reading help? R:\tNo. I:\tHow do you support yourself financially?  R:\tI work. I:\tAnd how much you earn? And this could be either by hour, by weekso what is your hourly rate? Thats probably the easiest way to go. R:\tI get $14 an hour. I:\tAnd can you tell me what your total household income is? Heres the list of categories. I would read it off, but that gets tedious. And you can just point at the one that   Now Id like to read you some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationships with your family. So here, Family\" means any kind of blood or legal relatives, people you have children in common with, and significant others, or guardians that you have lived with.  So the first set of questions is please respond to the following statements. And you can respond by saying Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, or Strongly disagree. Or it just doesnt apply to you. So, I feel close to my family. R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\tI want my family to be involved in my life. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tMy family is a source of support for me. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tI fight a lot with my family members. R:\t[Laugh] Strongly disagree. I:\tI often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tUmm  its neutral. I:\tIm criticized a lot by my family. R:\tNot at all. I:\tSo disagree? Or strongly disagree? R:\tDisagree. I:\tOkay. So again, with the Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree business. I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tHow many people would you say you can talk to about things that come up for you? R:\tI mean, it depends on what the subject is.  I:\tBut in general? R:\tLike four or five. On what the situation is, I got different people I can talk to on different things. I:\tYeah. And, I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem. R:\tAgree. Strongly agree. I:\tAnd how many would you say? About the same? R:\tLike two. I:\tAnd, I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tI would strongly agree. I:\tHow many people would you say? R:\tAll four. I:\tOkay. I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd about how many people would you say? Same?  R:\tSame. I:\tAnd, I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd about how many people would you say? R:\tSame. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed. R:\tStrongly agree.  I:\tAnd how many people would you say? R:\tAll of them. They do that now.  I:\tI have somebody in my family who would provide me with some financial support. R:\tOf course.  I:\tAnd how many would you say with that? R:\tAll.  I:\tAnd when you say all what do you  If you had to give it a number, would it be like ten? Five? Fifteen? Twenty? R:\tWell, like [inaudible 6:20] ten people. My family is like a very small family. Yeah.  I:\tBut you all support each other. R:\tYeah. We aint big. We aint no big family. I:\tOkay. So family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that are not in our best interestand can be sources of stress.  Can you describe for me some relationships with family and friends that provide examplesof both supportive and destructive or stressful influences on your life? So we could start with the good influences; the ways in which you feel like they bring out the best.  R:\tNumber one, my mom. She sees the best in me, even when Im wrong. Know what Im saying? So she always encourages me to better myself; not only for myself, but for my younger siblings looking up to me. My mom is one of the more supportive Ive got. Shes my backbone. Like, if it werent for her I wouldnt be alive today. I:\tSo give me an example of something your mother has done for you that made you feel like shes got your back, no matter what.  R:\tOkay, since were talking about criminal justices experiencesI got in trouble with the police. And I was in the wrong. I know I was in the wrong. But my mama? She didnt want to believe I was in the wrong. [Laugh] Even though I told her. Like, I know I was wrong. She still says  like, she still stuck up for me, likeno, youre right, youre right. I dont care what youre saying. They need to let you go. They [inaudible 7:55] arrest you for this and arrest you for that. She basically made me see the good in myself, and not only looking at that bad in myself. And that brought me  I mean, helped me get myself through the jail time I was doing. I:\tRight. R:\tSo shes my number one. I:\tTell me, [Name], when you say she sees the good in you when you see the badtell me whats the bad that you see in you? R:\tSometimes I doubt myself, so I say Im  I wont say I encourage myself, but I dont encourage myself, to push myself to where I can be. And I give up on myself a whole lot, like. And I do [inaudible 8:37] shell notice it, and shell Even though it might be the best way she might go about it, shell push me to  And shell encourage me to do my best of my ability. And make me want to prove her wrong. Like I can do it anyway. I:\tRight. R:\t[Inaudible 8:49], I mean I can do it. So it makes me want to do it even more. So its just the way she goes about it. Like, shell [tell? 8:55] me I cant do something, and she knowsjust by her telling me I cant do something? Im going to go do it. I:\tRight, right. So in some ways she kind of manipulates you to be your best. R:\tYeah. I:\tThats funny. So give me now an example of a situation where you feel like you might have family members or friends whose influence on you is not as good as your mothers might be. R:\tOh, my brothers. My big brothers. I actually followed behind my big brother a lot in the streets and stuff. Like, I followed him around a whole lot. So I cant sit here and put the blame on him, because its my actions. But the things I did, I followed behind him and learned from him. And I got everything from him, street-wise. My [inaudible] brother [inaudible 9:40]. Hes in jail now. Hes [inaudible 9:44]. But he was a bad influence on me, because I wanted to be like him. I wanted to do what he was doing, and dress how he dress and ride who he ride, and you know what Im saying? I just followed everything he was doing. Even though it wasnt good, but I thought it was because its my brotherright? My big brother is doing this, so it must be cool.  I:\tHow much older is he than you? R:\tHes only a year older than me. I:\tOkay, thats it? Wow. And so how long have you been that close? It sounds like youve been R:\tMe and my brother are very close. Yeah, me and him are very close. I:\tHow long? When did you feel like you started to latch onto him, and you guys would hang together? R:\tHonestly, almost [inaudible 10:27]. My brother, hes always been my hero. Hes always been the person I cling to. You know what Im saying? Like, always was on his [back? 10:35] or with him. Like, you see himyoure going to see me [inaudible 10:39] him. No matter if he wanted me to or not. Im just that annoying little sister. He cant get rid of me. And I always [inaudible 10:46]. Everywhere hes going, I wanted to go. If he was going somewhere to go do some  Even when I was younger, I still wanted to go. No matter what. Because its my brother. I wanted to be around him. I:\tHow long has he been in jail? R:\tIts going on three years now. I:\tOkay, so its prison then. R:\tYeah. I:\tHow have you felt about him being away? R:\tIts bittersweet. Part of me is sad, because hes not here with me physically. And then part of me is like maybe thats what he neededto sit him down and get his head on the right track and everything thats going on out here. I rather have him be in there than out here and not be here at all. I:\tRight. So in your mind, being in the neighborhood might be more dangerous than being in jail. R:\tYes. I:\tThats sad. Sorry. So the next set of questions is about your relationships to people outside of your family. I want you to think about three people with whom you feel closest personallysuch as friends. But this does not include your family or your romantic partner. So how many friends up to three do you feel closest to? R:\tI got three best friends. Exactly. I:\tSo lets start with one of your friends. I want you first to tell me whether its a male or female. R:\tFemale. I:\tWhat race or ethnicity? R:\tShes black. I:\tHow old is she? R:\tUmm  shes 24. I:\tOkay. And whats the highest level of education she has got? R:\tShes actually in college now. I:\tShes still in college. And is she working for pay? R:\tNo. Shes a self-owned  she do hair. I:\tSo shes kind of self-employed, then. R:\tYeah. I:\tIs she receiving public assistance? R:\tI think she gets food stamps. Thats about all I know. I:\tIs she married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd for the second personis that a male or a female? R:\tA female also. I:\tBlack? R:\tShes mixed race. Shes white and black. I:\tAnd how old is she? R:\tUmm, 24, too. I:\tOkay, and whats her highest level of education? R:\tHigh school I:\tAnd is she currently working for pay? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd is she receiving public assistance? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd is she married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay, so now the third person. Male or female? R:\tFemale. I:\tBlack? R:\tYes. I:\tAge? R:\t27. I:\tOh, older. R:\tYeah, older. I:\tWhats her level of education? R:\tI think she has some college experience. I dont know how far she went with it. I:\tAnd is she currently working for pay? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd has she ever received public assistance, or is she receiving it now? R:\tNot that I know of. I:\tAnd is she married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. So now Im going to ask you some questions about your affiliations. Again, if at any point you want to know why Im asking you these questionsjust stop me and ask. So this is basically do you belong to different kinds of organizations, how much do you participate. That kind of thing. So for instance, do you belong to a church, a synagogue, a mosque? That kind of thing? R:\tNo. I:\tA recreational club? R:\tNo. I:\tSports team? R:\tNo. Not recently, no. I:\tMusic or artist group? R:\tNo, maam. I:\tCrew or a gang? R:\tNo. I:\tLocal government? R:\tNo [Laugh] I:\tA civic association? R:\tNo. I:\tSupport group? R:\tNo. I:\tAny other kind of group that you might be a part of? R:\tNo, maam. I:\tOkay. So now Im on to employment. How old were you when you had your first job? R:\tEighteen. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life have you been employed? Like, all? Most? Some? R:\tMost of it, yeah. I:\tWhat skills do you bring to the labor market?  R:\tI got experience in warehouse work. I used to work at UPS. And [inaudible 15:12]. Im a cook, so I know how to do that. Security. Ive done security before. I:\tSo youve had a lot of different types of jobs you have experience with. R:\tYeah. I:\tWith the warehouse work, what kind of work would you do in the warehouse? R:\tJust load trucks and unload them. Boxes. I:\tHow did you like working for UPS? R:\tIt was cool. I mean, the hoursI liked the hours. I would go in at night and get off early in the morning, and I could have my whole day [inaudible 15:41]. [Inaudible] 10:00 at night, and do it over again. It was cool. Its like a workout. Its a workout. I:\tSo when did you sleep? R:\tUmm  just during the day. During the day. Id get off, go home. Go home [inaudible 15:58], wake up and go about my day. And then [inaudible 16:02] I:\tSo, [Name], given all the different kinds of jobs that youve donemoving forward, what do you see yourself doing in the next year or five years as you head closer to your 30s? What kind of work do you want to do? R:\tFor right now Im going to stick with the kitchen, because I like working in the kitchen. But my long-term goal is I want to go back to school to do construction. I want to learn how to build my own house. So thats one thing I would do. One thing I do want to learn how to do is build my own house. I:\tWhat draws you to that idea, of being able to build your own house? R:\tI dont know. Its just the concept of working with my hands. Building things with my hands, knowing that I built that. Like, thats mine. I built that. Having the joy of saying that I could [build?] something. And [inaudible 16:48] live in my own house like I can. Make it better for me. I:\tOkay. So what barriers to employment have you had since you started to work, if any? R:\tI dont understand the question. I:\tLike what kinds of things have gotten in your way of being able to get jobs, or whatever kind of job you wanted to get? R:\tMy background. Of course my background, thats number one. But  and my medical, too. I have medical problems. I:\tWould you like to go into that, or do you want to keep that R:\tYeah, Ill keep that. I:\tSo when you say that its your backgroundhow do you know that thats had an impact? R:\tBecause [inaudible 17:53] the background checks it pops up, and they know. They let it be known that it pops up and thats the reason why you didnt get the job. So thats how I know for sure its my background.  I:\tSo at your current job it was not an issue for them? R:\tNo. It wasnt. Because it happened a long time ago. So they didnt look at it as something I did recently. I:\tRight. You were still [inaudible 18:17]. How many jobs do you currently hold? R:\tOne. I:\tFor your current job what would you say is your job title? R:\tLine cook. I:\tAnd when did you begin this job? R:\tUmm  its July? In February. I:\tIs it full- or part-time? R:\tFull. I:\tIts not easy getting a full-time job anymore, right? R:\tYeah, its not. I:\tHow did you find this job? R:\tActually, I was referred to it by a friend. She basically said they were about to have a grand opening and they still were hiring people. I applied online. I went for the interview, and Im thinking Im going for the interviewbut they actually hired me on the spot.  I:\tWow. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd had you had restaurant experience before that one? R:\tNo. I:\tIt was the warehouse and all those other things, but not R:\tYeah. I:\tThats [inaudible 19:30]. So how much money did you  you said you earn $14 now? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo in general, how would you describe your experiences in the labor market so far? So since youve been working, when you look back on your five years of work experience, nowhow would you describe your labor market experiences? R:\tA growth experience. Because everything that Ive done in the past made me who I am. Not made me who I am, but basically  yeah, made me who I am. A different outlook on things. Ive learned different things. [Inaudible 20:18] thing I would learn [inaudible]. Because I didnt think I would be working in a kitchen. I dont be in my own kitchen at home, so I didnt think Id be in the kitchen working. So its good things. [Inaudible 20:31] take everything I did in the past. I got to take some good out of it. You cant take  youve got to take something out of everything.  I:\tIn some of the other studies that Ive done I would ask people this question, and ask them to tell me some of the good things that youve gotten and also told me some of the bad things that youve gotten out of it. When you describe the growth that youve hadtell me some of the things that youve learned about yourself as the result of the experiences that youve had? R:\tMy anger. I got to control my anger a whole lot. Especially dealing with people  Especially with me dealing with other people, working with other people. Because UPS, I worked with one other person. It would be like me and some other dude doing the trucks. So it wouldnt be like a whole group of people. I:\tRight. R:\tBut now in my job its a whole kitchen staff. So I had to learn how to take my  I learned how to control my anger and learned how to talk to people in the same way that I want to be talked to. I dont know. I:\tWhat happened that made you feel like, Ive got to do this. Ive got to figure out how to be in a group and get along with other people. R:\tI wasnt a very people-friendly person. I like meeting new people, but I never am the one to be around like large groups or go to parties and be around a whole lot of people. Im very claustrophobic. I dont like being in enclosed in a lot of places. Yeah, I dont like being  I never liked dealing with people. I was never people-friendly. So I had to learn how to deal with that, because I worked in the kitchen. So I had to learn how to adjust myself and my attitude to dealing with people, and dealing with other people in the kitchen. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd then in a large group, period. I:\tSo is it easier now for you to be in larger groups, now that youve had this experience? R:\tYeah, it is. I:\tAnd were there things about yourself that you didnt like? R:\tThat I didnt like? My anger. I used to get mad real quick. It used to take like anything to get me mad. But now I got it controlled to a point where it takes me a whole lot to get me bad. Because its [inaudible 22:46] ruin my day. I:\tYouve learned a lot in a short period of time. I think it took me 20 years to get to the place where you are now. So is there anything that you would like to add or talk about with regard to your work experience? Either positive experiences or negative experiences that stand out to you? R:\tUmm  I mean, negative experiencesthe reason why I stopped working at UPS. I actually, the [thing? 23:22] Im in now, I ended up buying a ring for at a store. And I didnt want to leave it at home. So I had it in my backpack, [inaudible 23:33] having her finding it. Its in the case and everything still. And UPS thought I stole the ring off the truck. Yeah. So I gave them the receipt. You know what Im saying? I [inaudible 23:42] receipt. I paid cash with it. I gave them the store number and everything. They still tried to  Yes, they still fired me for stealing off of a truck. I:\tDespite the fact that you had the evidence to show. R:\tYes. Despite the fact that I had the evidence to show I didnt do it. I:\tAnd so how are you feeling about that now? R:\tNow? I mean, Im over it and its old. But its still like  it still is wrong.  I:\tWhat do you think was behind that? Why do you think they were so insistent that you stole [inaudible]? R:\tI have no idea. Honestly. I have no idea.  I:\tAnd so thats a very negative experience. Does a positive experience come to mind when you think about your past five years of working? R:\tYes. If I hadnt ever stopped working at UPS I wouldnt have gotten the job Im at now. So its something good that came out of it.  I:\tYes. So the next set of questions are about substance abuse. The following questions are about experiences you may have had with substance abuse, if any. Remember that all your responses will be kept private. And again, remember that if you dont feel comfortable answering you dont have to. So have you ever had a drinking or a drug problem? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay, so were done with that. Well, has anyone ever suggested that you had a drinking or a drug problem? R:\tUmm, no. I mean, I dont drink. So I dont like drinking, because my fathers side is alcoholics. So I guess if you grow up seeing that, and its not what I want. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd drug problem? I dont think I have no drug problem. I aint never [inaudible 25:32] drug problem. Thats news. I:\tBut that smile  what is the smile? I feel like the smile is covering up something. R:\tNo, it aint covering up nothing. I mean, I do smoke marijuana [inaudible 25:43] and thats not [inaudible]. But I dont think I have a drug problem with it because I dont need it every day. I dont need it to keep me up, or keep me who I am. I can go without it. I can go days and  without it. So I dont think its a problem. I:\tSo its not an issue. R:\tYeah, its not an issue at all. I:\tOkay. So the next set of questions are about mental and emotional health. And again, remember that all of your answers will be kept private. R:\tOkay. I:\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professionalsuch as a psychiatrist or a psychologist, or a social worker or a psychiatric nurse that you had a mental or emotional condition? R:\tNo.  I:\tHave you ever thought that you might have an emotional or mental condition? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tHave you ever thought that you might have a learning disability? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tHave you ever taken medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or a doctor R:\tNo, none. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental health hospital? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of an emotional or mental health issue? R:\tNo. I havent. I:\tOkay, so now were onto the experiences about the criminal justice system. These questions may be sensitive and emotional to answerso remember again that you are not required to answer any question. And we can take a break and stop the interview at any time. So approximately how many times have you been arrested? R:\tUmm  maybe five. I:\tWhat offenses have you been arrested for? Here, let me show you the list. And tell meDUI, weapons possession R:\tAssault. I:\tYou can just check them off it will be easier for you. R:\tYes, it would be assault. And then the robbery thing. I:\tWere there any other kinds that are not on this list? R:\tAssault and battery. I dont know if thats on there.  I:\tHow old were you the first time you were arrested? R:\tUmm  16. I:\tOkay. Please describe the event of your arrest from the moment that you were approached by police officers and taken into custody until the point of your arraignmentassuming that you had an arraignment. So describe as much as you feel comfortable with. R:\tThe first time I ever got arrested I was in high school. I was going to Oakland High. And I even played basketball there. I seen my little sister getting arrested, actually, first. So I was outside the game, a football game. So I seen her. I actually hopped over the fence to see what was going on with her. And the school officer told me likeits okay, shes just going home. Were going to take her home. She had a fight, were going to take her home. So I said okay, Ill leave it alone.  So I hopped back over the fence to get back into the game. And another schoolthe school we were playing, the team, the security guard came over and tried to pull me out of the game. Mind you, Im in full-blown basketball uniform. You knew, you could tell I went to the school.  He basically had me like hemmed up; like, grabbed me like this, trying to [inaudible 29:32] at the game. And when he let me go I had bruises on my arms. So I got mad. And I took off on him. I hit him. The police came, and they had me in the back of the police car for a long time. Yeah, for a long time. They didnt even contact my mama until I got to the actual jailhouse. I:\tHow much time between, would you estimate, between R:\tI got arrested  my game, my basketball game ended at around like 5:00. The football game started like around 5:30, 6:00. I got arrested around like 6:30. I didnt get to the jailhouse around like 10:00, maybe 9:00. So it was a long time. And we were just sitting there in front of my school for a long time. Just sitting there. And I didnt understand why.  I:\tSo what were they doing? R:\tNothing. I guess the  they werent doing nothing. I dont know if they were talking to [inaudible 30:24] outside the car. But I was just sitting in the car. And they were talking to the security guard that I fought. And then they drove off, and I was still sitting in the car. Across the street from the school. I was looking at this [inaudible 30:33]. I dont know if they were monitoring the game or something. I dont have no idea. But I just sat there until the game was over. And then when the game was over, thats when we left. And the only way I kind of  the only way that somebody knew that I was arrested was because we were driving up High Street and I actually see my sisters and them. Like out the car, like, Call mommy. [Laugh] So, yeah. [Inaudible 30:58] car, like call. Im likehelp me. So, yeah. Thats the first time I ever went to jail. Juvenile Hall, I should say, I guess.  I:\tAnd so what happened once you got to  Did they bring you directly to Juvenile Hall? R:\tYes. I:\tSo tell me about that whole situation. R:\tThey took me to Juvenile Hall. They booked me. Fingerprints, picture. They did a search on me. Gave me some clothes, and had me in the holding tank for a cool minute. And then they ended up finally putting me in the unit after like [two? twelve? 31:33] hours of me being there. Finally put me in the unit. Being in the unit is  I want to say its no ideal for no child to be in no juvenile hall at all. Thats one place I would not want to wish my worst enemies on at all. For real. For real. Its unsanitized. Its very nasty. Very nasty. The food is  they shouldnt be serving that at all. I dont think they eat it. They still serve it to us. For real.  Umm  I [inaudible 32:10] some of the staff that was there, some of them really did care about the problems that we had and the problems that may be going on. What led us to get to where we at now, and how well be doing when we get out. We had little sessions, like writing sessions where we would talk and stuff about whats going on. But other than that we wasnt  I was just reading books, trying to kill my time. I:\tSo when you got there, and theyre booking you, and then theyre giving you stuff to wear, what were you feeling? R:\tI was angry. I didnt want to be there. I wanted to go home. I felt like they was keeping my captive, holding me against my will. I:\tWere you worried at all about your safety?  R:\tOf course. I never trust the police anyway, so of course I was afraid for my safety. Then they had me in places where  They had me in with other kids. Like I said, I wasnt very  I as very nonchalant. I didnt like being around people. So of course I was worried for my safety around other people who I dont know what theyre in jail for. I:\tAt 16 I can imagine that that would be  well, at any age frankly, it would be overwhelming. The unsanitary conditions, was this where you were R:\tSleeping, eating, walking. I:\tEverywhere? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo it sounds like when the police stopped you, it sounds like in that situation you felt like you were treated unfairly. Correct me if Im wrong. They put you in the cop car. R:\tYeah, of course. They should have first and foremost, because I was a minor contacted my parents. Im saying thats the first thing they should have did. They could have let me go. Im saying, all they had to do is come to my parents and have them come pick me up. But I guess that wasnt an option. Im saying I guess he had thoughts in mind of taking me to jail. Its like they want to book somebody. They want to have somebody inside the cells. I:\tIn that situation it sounds like as a minor your rights were violated. Were there any other aspects of your experience that day that you felt like your rights may have been violated? R:\tThe only part of that, I was just still a minor, and Im saying I didnt get the  My parents wasnt called. I wasnt taken directly to the jail. That right there, that [inaudible] make a problem. [Inaudible] was a problem. I:\tWhen your mother found out, how did she respond? R:\tShe was very angry. She was upset about what I had done, upset that I put my hands on an adult. But once she found out the reason why I had did it, Im saying, the reason why I done what I done, she wasnt angry at me. I think she was more angry at why they didnt call her or why they didnt let anyone know. Why did my sister have to tell her that I was arrested? I:\tWhen you went back to school, how were you treated? R:\tThey kicked me out of school. Yeah, they kicked me out of school. I couldnt play basketball no more. I lost a scholarship. I think what I did just messed a lot of stuff up. I:\tTell me more about that. R:\tI had a full college scholarship to Clark, playing basketball. But I got arrested, and they seen that. They didnt want no more. I went to the continuation school after that. It just went downhill after I got out of jail. Its like I wasnt who I was no more. I couldnt play ball. Its something that I wanted to play. I couldnt do that no more. When I got out of high school, I know that I was going to college. Now that I know that Im not going, Im like  Basically I lost a lot of my spirit and confidence in myself, should I say, when that happened. I:\tIs this where your mother started to try to get you ... R:\tYeah. I:\tShe saw you losing touch with who you are. How many times, [Name], have you been convicted? In that situation it doesnt sound like you were convicted of anything. R:\tYeah, I was convicted actually for assault. Yeah, I was in juvenile hall for about 30 days. And I ended up getting ORd. But then the second time in jail as an adult, I actually  assault again. In my head its self-defense because she hit me. The officer, police officer, actually. I went to jail for fighting a police officer in San Francisco. Yes. It was when the Giants had won the World Series actually. Everybody out there turned up, having fun. Shit had been happening between me and my friends. So I got mad and walked away. And Im walking away rolling me some marijuana up. Basically, Im about to calm myself my down. I dont know what the reason was, or why I did it, but the officer had  she came from behind and tackled me. Like, lightweight. Me, I dont know who it was, I fought back. You come from behind, I aint knowing who you was. After I fighting back, a group of officers came and I guess trying to help him, but they all was on me. Its like say, its like me and you officers. Im saying you did it, he saying he did it, he saying he did it. Im saying a chain of command, a chain saying everybody did it. I didnt go to jail for that. That right there was [inaudible 37:36] at all. Because the officer, he was racist and he was sexist. Like, he told me he would stick his D in my mouth to shut me up. Yes. Because I was lesbian. They said little stuff that wasnt right, straight up. And that made me really, really mad. I started going off again. And I got hit in my head with a club. They took it  I got a dent in my brain from the situation. I:\t[Name], do you mind describing how this all happened? At what point could he R:\tI dont know how it happened, or what his intention was to come grab me, or what the decision was. I know that when he did grab me, my mind focus was defending myself. I dont care if its a police officer or not, Im going to defend myself. [Inaudible 38:25] police officer, I start restraining. Then I stop, calm down. By then, they all on top of me. So its like there wasnt nothing I could do because they was all holding me down. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. How many total were there? Do you remember? Like five? R:\tIt was more than five. They were all out for the baseball game. It was way more than five. I:\tWhat point did you get into  Did the one police officer essentially verbally assault you by suggesting that  Because he assumed that you were a lesbian. R:\tYeah, he was trying to put me inside the car. And I wasnt going. I wasnt going willingly. Hes saying stuff just to get me inside there. I guess I wasnt cooperating with him, I was making him mad. He just gets to say and do anything he wants to say. I:\tRight. So were you then convicted once or twice? R:\tTwice. The juvenile case, and then the adult case. I:\tThe convictions were then for the assault? R:\tAssault. I:\tOkay. How old were you with the first conviction? 16? R:\t18. No, the first conviction I was 16. The second one, I was 18. I:\tOkay. The first time you were in juvie hall, that was 16, right? R:\tYeah. I:\tHave you ever been to jail? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow old were you the first time? R:\t18. I stayed in there for like two days, but then I got bailed out for that case. And then the second time as an adult I went to jail, I was there for like a week, and I got ORd again. I:\tSo youve been to jail two times, and a total of maybe 15, 16 days? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd you went to juvie hall once? R:\tYes. I:\tYou stayed there for what? Total of 30 days or something? Is that what you said? R:\tYeah. I:\tNever been to prison? R:\tNo. I:\tEver been on probation or parole? R:\tOn probation, yeah. I:\tRight now? R:\tNo, actually I got off probation. I:\tOkay. Was it when you were 20, or 18? R:\tYeah, I got on when I was 18. I:\tHow long were you on there for? R:\tThree years. I:\tI think thats pretty typical, yeah. So is there anything else youd like to add about this experience? R:\tI dont know. No. I:\tNow Id like to read you some statements that describe how you might feel about legal authorities. So please respond to the following statements with, again, strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree. I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.  R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tStrongly disagree? Or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tPeople should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tNo. I:\tSomewhat or strongly? R:\tStrongly. If its wrong, its wrong. If its right, its right. I:\tIt is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tOf course. Strongly. I:\tThe law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me. R:\tYeah. I:\tWould you say strongly or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tOf course. I:\tIm going to take it thats strongly agree? R:\tYes. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tToo true. Strongly. I:\tOkay. Most police in my city do their job well. R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tStrongly or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. Because some do, some dont. Theres some good ones, theres some bad ones. I:\tOkay. Most police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tIm neutral about that. Some do, some dont. I:\tSo neither agree nor disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. Three more on this. The basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police. R:\tI agree. Somewhat agree, yeah. I:\tThe police in my city have too much power. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd, Most police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. Have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened, abused, and/or otherwise treated inappropriately by police? R:\tOf course. I:\tBesides what youve already shared with me, is there anything else that youd like to share that is consistent with this? R:\tJust recently I went to the Sacramento Fair. And me and my girlfriend; my friend was actually driving my moms car. He pulled us over he said because our registration was bad, I guess. The law, youve got 60 days to get registration put in before they dont bother you. Registration had just turned bad a couple days ago, but they pulled us over. Said that theyd run our names. They didnt give us a ticket for the registration. They gave my girlfriend a ticket for her license being expired. Yeah, I guess they had reason for them to run our names or whatever it was. But if they pulled us over for registration, why I didnt get a ticket for registration? I:\tRight, right. R:\tThey didnt say nothing about license or registration. Ask for registration at all. He said something about it, but then after he run our names, he seen that her license was expired. He didnt say nothing else about the registration at all. I:\tSo how did you feel after that stop? R:\tI feel like they were just bored. They wanted somebody to bother. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I have to admit, in that situation, Id be pissed. Assuming that youre anything like me, I wonder how you deal with your anger around that situation, or situations like that. R:\tI wanted to [inaudible 45:06] so bad. I wanted to hit somebody. I wanted to do a lot of things. But I had to calm myself down and really think. If I do this, what would the outcome be? If I do this, what would that reaction be? So I just sat there. I let them do their jobs, know what Im saying? We rode off with some ticket for her license and I had to smoke a cigarette to calm my nerves down. Because being in Sacramento, it wasnt [inaudible 45:30]. I was very angry. I was very angry about it. I:\tHow did they respond? R:\tAbout me being angry? I:\tAbout the whole situation in general? R:\tThey just did what they had to do. They gave her a ticket and they let us go basically. I:\tHow many times would you say stuff like that happens to you, or has happened to you in your lifetime? R:\tLike, three. Thats why I stay away from police. I:\tYeah. Sometimes you cant avoid them Im assuming, though. R:\tYeah, you cant. I:\tWhen did this last happen? R:\tI want to say three weeks ago. Not even a whole month ago. I:\tOkay. So to what extentand howdo you think race has shaped your experience with the police? R:\tI think raced has a big part in it. Honestly, I do. Because if they didnt see my skin the way it was, they probably think nothing of it at all. I think they judge off the way these people living now, [inaudible 46:43] you are. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. You also mentioned earlier when you were talking about being outside I think of the ball game, that you think the cop also targeted you, or treated you badly because he assumed you were a lesbian. R:\tYeah. I:\tHow much do you think that is also playing a role? R:\tI think that plays a role, too. Because you got a lot of people out here who are very homophobic [inaudible 47:04] about the life that I live, or who dont agree with the things that I do, or just my lifestyle period. Know what Im saying? That right there, thats a disgrace. That shows a whole lot of character in who they is, and about a person, about who they are. My mama always told me to not forgive and forget, but forgive and move onand dont let it happen again. I:\tIn this situation, how do you stop it from happening again? R:\tIts not that I can stop it from happening again, its just how can I stop it from letting it affect me. Because its happening. Its out of my hands. Its going to always happen. Its just the process of how Im going to take it in and how Im going to let it affect me in a good way or a bad way. Like, someone comes to me and tells me Im an ugly lesbian or something like  Anything disgraceful to my community. And I look at them and just laugh at them. That shows who you really are, bro. You look [inaudible 48:02] about yourself that youre just trying to put me down. Because youre the one mad, because Im not the one mad. Youre the one mad. It really affects  Its [inaudible 48:11] how I bring it into myself, and how I take it, and how I let it affect myself. If I let it affect me in a bad way then Im going to get [inaudible 48:17] and Im going to fight this person and [inaudible 48:19] this person. Thats not how I was raised at all. I:\tYeah. Now Im going to ask youwere going to move onto the next section about your experiences in detention. You mentioned that you spent some days in jail? I think it was a little over two weeks in jail, so Im going to talk about those experiences. You already described for me the circumstances that led to your arrest; this is a situation where the cops came from behind you. Is there anything else that youd like to add to that before I move onto ask some questions about that? R:\tNo. I:\tYou said that you were held in detention for about two weeks? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhen you were in detention, what was a typical day like? R:\tWake up. Go to breakfast, see what they got. Grab a book. Sit there, I eat. I got time enough to eat. After I eat, go back to my cell. Read the book, sit there. [Inaudible 19:36] come out for pod[?] time. I go out, watch TV, play cards. Pod[?] time over, grab me another book and go back to my cell. Read it, go back and come back out for dinner. Eat and then you on lock down after that. Thats a typical day. I:\tSo you did that for two weeks? R:\tYeah. Read a lot of books. I:\tWhat kind of books were you reading? R:\tI like urban[?] books, like The Coldest Winter Ever, stuff like that. [Inaudible 50:07]. I like her books. [Inaudible] I dont know. I remember there were some that sparked my interest. If they spark my interest Ill read it. I:\tRight. When you were there, what were the biggest challenges that you faced in your day? R:\tNot getting in competition with nobody. Because its about territory up there. Who bigger, who badder, who weak or who not. Especially in jail, they try to pick you out. See how you react. Actually if youre strong enough to [inaudible 50:43]. Actually, it all about how you take it in and let people affect yourself. If you feed into it, then youre just average. But if you dont, you [inaudible 50:52] time out, then youll be all right. But if you feed into it, youll be miserable. I:\tDid you feel like you were being tested? That you had been tested? R:\tOf course. I:\tTell me how they tested you. R:\tSomebody tried to take my food. Somebody tried to [inaudible 51:07], when I first got in the cell  Im serious. It really happens. For real. I got my bunkie, actually. I had the top bunk, she had the bottom bunk. She tried to take the top bunk because she didnt want to sleep so low. I dont know. She tried to punk me out of being in the bed. I:\tShe physically pulled you out of the bed? R:\tYeah. I cant say nothing to the COs. I already maybe labeled me as a snitch in jail. It basically tested my  how I handle the situation. I just gave her the bed. I aint going to fight with you. I aint about to sit here and put more time on my sentence I already got. Thats it. So you want the bed, you can have it. I aint going to fight with you. I:\tDid you know at that point how many days you had? R:\tNo, I didnt. I:\tSo you were just waiting and you werent quite sure how long you were going to be in there. R:\tNo. I:\tAnd you said you ended up being released on OR? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo you had to be patient and kind of try to back away from trouble without even knowing how long you were going to have to put up with this stuff? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I didnt want nothing to get added onto what I was about to get already charged with. So I had to think smart about the situation instead of thinking dumb about it. I:\tCan you describe any of the informal rules that you had to live by while you were in jail? Like, who gets to use the phone, or when, or how youre not supposed to look into other peoples eyes. That kind of thing. R:\tIts not really laws, its just on a whim. If the phones open, its open. You can go and use it. It dont matter what phone you got. I think that right there, it depends on the jail you in. I was at Santa Rita, and I didnt see none of that going on in the jail I was in. I could use the phone when I need the phone. I could look at who I wanted to look at. I could do what I was going to do [inaudible 52:59 ].  Yeah, I dont think none of that happened when I was there. Only thing was like, who was the boss. Who was the shot caller, or who was the top notch. Thats pretty much what it was. Who was the head honcho of the cell block. Who is restricting where the cell blocks are. Who held the highest of the high. I:\tRight. By being the highest of the high, what do you get by being the highest of the high? R:\tI dont know. I was not there  I was the lowest of the low. [Laugh] I wanted to keep it that way. I was the lowest of the lows. I want to keep it that way. I was not trying to be in there no longer than I already was. I:\tRight, right. Okay, during your detention can you describe responsibilities or obligations on the outside that you could not fulfill because you were in there?  R:\tMy job. I aint have no job more. It robbed me of security. I didnt have a job no more. Thats really about it. I lost my job. I:\tYou got fired after they found out that you were R:\tYeah. Because I was actually in jail and I guess they  Yeah, I was actually in jail. After I got out of jail, I was fired. They sent my last check home. And it was what it was. I:\tWas it because of the charge, or was it because they just didnt  because you werent there and so they just R:\tBecause I wasnt there. No call, no show. It wasnt because of the charge. I:\tYeah, okay. Any other obligations or responsibilities that you couldnt fulfill because you were- R:\tUh-uh [no]. Thats about it. [Inaudible 54:42]. I:\tOkay. Can you tell me about any arrangements that you made so that your responsibilities or  So in that situation you didnt get somebody to call them to let them know? R:\tNo. I:\tCan I ask why? R:\tI wasnt thinking about it at the time. It wasnt a thought in my head until actually I got  I [inaudible] call nobody and tell them about it. Yeah, I didnt think about it. Im sorry, Im just tired. I:\tNo, dont worry. I wont take it personally. Tell me what you were thinking about while you were in there. Im assuming you called your mother, or somebody called your mother, and that you spoke to her. Maybe you spoke to your siblings. I dont know if you were with someone at that time. What was going on for you during those two weeks, that two-week period. R:\tI need to hurry up and get the hell out of here and dont come back. Its not for me. I:\tYeah. R:\tAll it was, is thinking how I was going to get out and not come back to it at all. I:\tWhat did it mean to not come back? R:\tIt meant everything not to go back to that. Everything. I would do anything other than go to jail. I havent been in jail in a minute, so Im not trying to  Thats not who I am. Jail is not for me at all. Like, at all. Not yet. Jails not for me at all. Yeah, I wouldnt be able to survive in jail, straight up. The little time I did do, scared me. So I couldnt imagine me trying to do even longer. It wouldnt be [inaudible 56:04] that way. Id probably panic and go crazy in that thing. I:\tYeah, yeah. Your desire to not go back, is that in part why youve dealt with some of the anger issues? R:\tYeah. Of course, of course. I think my anger caused a lot of stuff in my life. I had to learn how to show my anger, I had to learn how to grow up. Part of me growing up is trying to handle how to show my anger. I:\tYeah. Okay. So what types of services or programs were available to you while you were in detention? R:\tNone really. I didnt really even think about that. I was just worried about going to court and getting out. I:\tHow did the OR situation happen? Did somebody contact you and say R:\tNo, actually I went to court. Its called being released on my own recognizance. Basically, I had to be on court probation. I had to sign to a plea deal. I guess if I get caught up with this again, I got to do the full time amount of the charges I already been charged with. Plus a charge that Im being charged with if I go to jail. Its like that. For me, I cant do it at all. So I just told myself Im going to stay out of trouble. And I have ever since. I:\tSo you went back to court and they said heres the deal. Were going to let you go on your own recognizance. And as long as you stay out of trouble  for how long? R:\tFor three years. I:\tFor three years, okay. During your probation period, if youre good then this is it. Basically, your probation will be your punishment. R:\tYeah. But the day after that I actually got in trouble again. The robbery thing came across, but I would say  I was with somebody. They robbed somebody before I got with them, and then I got caught up with them. I didnt actually commit the robbery. I just rode up at the wrong time with somebody who did. Yeah. I:\tYou got arrested for that, but you didnt get convicted if it. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tOkay. That must have been scary. R:\tYeah, of course. Yeah, I was scared, I was nervous. I was crying. Im like  what did I do to deserve this? Why? Why? Why? I thought I was about to shut down, because robberythats a serious crime. Its a felony. They dont mess me on that, its a felony. I:\tRobbery is when you hold someone up and you have a weapon, right? R:\tYeah. You actually face-to-face robbing somebody. Yeah, thats robbery. Thats not burglary, know what Im saying? Robbery is, thats intentional. That means you intended to go to somebody and take  Know what Im saying? I cant do it, I cant do it. I:\tRight. You told them that wasnt me. We didnt meet up until later, after the robbery.? R:\tYeah, the dude actually corroborated. Actually, I guess the police was following him or something. They seen me get in the car with him and they seen him picking me up. They know I just got in the car with him, but he actually told them thatyeah, [inaudible 28:58]. I told themI just got picked up, bro. I dont know how you call this [inaudible 59:05]. Know what Im saying? Thats my [inaudible], but for real, for real. I aint got time for that. I aint got time for it. I:\tYeah. When this happened  So you had been working hard to stay out of trouble and then this thing happens. R:\tI was scared. I was terrified. I thought they were about to take me to jail. I:\tFor something you didnt do. R:\tYeah, exactly. [Inaudible 29:24] for something I didnt do. I:\tYeah. R:\tI was really scared. I:\tDid that affect how you behaved thereafter? I mean, heres where Im going with that, and then you tell me if this was true for you. If that had happened to me, Id be likeoh shit. I just got to stay away from R:\tEverybody. Everybody. I:\tJust being in touch with somebody going to get you in trouble. R:\tYeah, I dont have lots of friends. I dont have friends. I got my girlfriend, my number one friend. She keep me out of trouble, straight up. If Im not with her, Im at home or Im at work. I dont got time for everybody and they foolery in these streets. I dont have time for it. Nope, aint about to risk my life. Let alone go to jail for something that I know I didnt do and somehow could have prevented from being around, or anything. I dont know who knows who did what out here. As far as me to sit and protect myself and keep myself out the situation, I just I:\tYou just keep to yourself. R:\tYeah, keep  For the [inaudible 60:24]. I just keep to myself, yeah. I:\tOf the friends that you have had as you were coming up  Have any of them stayed out of trouble? R:\tYeah, actually the three friends I do have, Im going to say only one has been in trouble with the law. I:\tOkay. R:\tAnd that was a while back. It happened in her adulthood. The 27 year-old. The beginning of her adult years. But as of now I cant say she had been. Shes actually one of my biggest supporters. Somebody who encourages me. One of my mentors. So I dont think shell do something  not only [inaudible 61:03] predicament having me looking up to her likedamn girl; Im taking advice from you, girl. You just did this and Im looking at you like  Know what Im saying? Yeah, Im the person in that predicament there, let me down. That let herself down even more. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. How did your family react when they found out that you were in jail? R:\tThey didnt like it. My mama especially didnt like it. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tShe didnt like it. I didnt like it either. [Laugh] I mean, but I did do what I did. I cant blame nobody but myself for it, so I had to suffer my consequences. I understood that, they understood that. It just a matter of time, like I say, what Im going to do when I get out. I will not go back in that place again. I:\tSo your mom in particular, was she disappointed? R:\tShe was seriously mad. I mean, [inaudible 62:01] in jail. When she figured out why the reason was, she didnt  she cant be mad. Like I say, I had bruises on my arms, so I basically had to defend myself. Even to police officers, I defend myself.  Yes, of course she was upset. Any mother be upset if her child in jail. Like I said, she said that I put myself in that predicament, but it wasnt nothing she could do because Im in jail. What can you do from jail? Whoop me in jail? You wish you can, but you cant do that. I:\tWhen you got out of jail, how were things with her? R:\tI got yelled at, I got cussed out. But I had to do what I needed to do. Where I needed to be at, where I dont need to be at. Who I can be trusting myself with and  Whole long list of stuff that she said. Some of it I dont remember, some of it I do. Shes just being a parent. I cant get mad at her for it. I know she wouldnt cuss me out if she didnt love me. I:\tYeah. Thats what youre saying now, about three years later. How are you feeling in the moment when you know the [inaudible 63:05] coming at you around the same time?  R:\tNow Im cool because I know I aint putting myself in a predicament again with the law. Now, Im fine. I got nothing to worry about now. Im off probation. I just got off in March, so Im doing good. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Did you celebrate once you got? R:\tOh yeah, oh yeah. Yes. I was so happy. I was in my house, celebrating in my house, not outside. I cant do it. I:\tWhat does it mean now to be off probation?  R:\tNo paperwork. I aint got to look over my shoulder and worry about if I  Knock on wood, not saying I would get in trouble with the law, but if I do was to get in trouble with the law now, I aint got to worry about another charge that I had a couple years ago. You know what Im saying? Me doing time for that. Its just a relief. Its just a relief. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. How often did you have to check in? R:\tAt first it was every week, but then it went from every week to every two weeks. I:\tThen it remained every two weeks until the end of it? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhen you were in jailsorry to bring you back therewere there people that you thought youd stay in touch with, but who you didnt stay in touch with? R:\tTheres one person I thought Id stay in touch with, and actually still in touch with her to this day. She was one that was a big support inside jail. She was actually the first person that gave me a bible inside the jailhouse, to calm me down. Sit here and read this until you get through it. Dont let  she be a positive influence on me while I was in jail. Actually, when I got out, I reached out to her when I got out of jail. And I come to find out that I knew her daughter. I:\tWow. R:\tHer daughter had just got cut up and had got killed. I actually knew her daughter, so I found out I knew her daughterand me and her still to this day, we just talked the other day. We still close friends. She feels like a god mother to me, to this day. I:\tWhen you were in jail, did she see that you were struggling and did she come up to you? Or how that? R:\tShe heard me crying. And I didnt want to show her that I was crying, but she kind of figured out I was crying because she heard me, I guess. She was just standing there, talking to me and calmed me down and basically reassured me that I would be okay and that I could get out of this situation. Some other people, they going to be here for a long time. And she showed me that I going to be all right. That everybody goes through it. Its my first time in an adult jail so, of course Im going to have emotions. Im going to be emotional and scared. Yeah, I really appreciated her for that because  Yeah, I really appreciated her for that. She didnt have to do what she did. I:\tShe didnt. And I can see how that would help you get through and you feel like somebody behind there had your back. R:\tYeah. I:\tHow often do you stay in touch with her now? R:\tI talk to her like every couple days, maybe through the week. I:\tOkay, thats a lot. R:\tYeah, we talk a lot. Actually, her granddaughter just had a birthday party. Her daughters daughter had a birthday party. I went to her birthday party. It was cool. Yeah, I still talk to her. I:\tThats very cool. R:\tYeah, she doing goodso thats good.  I:\tDid you feel, when you were insideand I know it was just the two weeks, but did you feel like you had difficulties staying in touch with your family? R:\tNo, because I was arguing with my aunt. Every time I had a chance to, I called. My mom probably got tired of me calling her, but I called her every chance I got, no matter what. I:\tIt wasnt a problem at all? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tAnd with OR, did that come with bail? Did you have to pay bail? R:\tNo, no. You have to pay restitution, though. Not bail. I:\tOkay. Were going to get to questions about that a little bit later. Im just answering these questions because youve already told me just by telling me these stories. Thats why Im going through this because I dont want to have to ask you again.  So what sorts of negative consequences did you experience as a result of being held in pretrial detention? You lost your job; that was one. R:\tYeah, I lost my job. I:\tDid you lose a relationship, custody of children, housing, car, property? A greater debt? Did you have any debt that came with it? R:\tI had to pay the restitution. I had to pay them. I had to pay for my anger management classes, too, that I had to take. I:\tDo you remember how much the anger management classes were? R:\tNo, I dont. I:\tHow was your experience in detention different from what you expected it would be? R:\tI didnt expect it to be nothing. I never expected to be in there. Yeah, it was really  I:\tYou never imagined it? R:\tMe being in jail? No, no. I never thought Id be in jail. I never thought Id be the one to get arrested. None of that at all. Like I said, I was an athlete. I was always in basketball. I had a scholarship. So in my head, I didnt want to mess that up, and I did. I didnt think  Yeah, I didnt think Id be there. I:\tYou never imagined that kind of future for yourself? R:\tYeah, at all. I:\tWere you changed in any way by detention? R:\tChanged? Made me not want to go there no more. If thats what you want to call change, then I guess so. It made me not want to be there. I:\tYou were suggesting that because you didnt want to go back, it was one of the things that inspired you to deal with the anger and that kind of thing. R:\tYeah. I:\tI imagine, if anything good came out of detention, it was that it in some ways forced you to deal with that. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIs there anything else that you would like to add about your experience in detention? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tOkay. Now, pretrial diversion. You did go through a pretrial diversion experience, right? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tThis section is going to be about the process by which you were assessed in pretrial diversion. Do you know what I mean when I say assessed? What often happensand youll tell me if you had this experienceis theyll basically give you an interview or a set of interviews. In the interviews, theyre trying to determine what your risk level was, risk of reoffending, but they also try to assess what needs you have. I assume they ask you a whole set of questions to try to get at that.  And then they have some equation to figure out how risky you are, but also to figure out what kind of needs you have. Then they set you up with different kinds of programs. Do you remember a situation in which anybody interviewed you about anything? R:\tNo, it just  they said I had to go to anger management classes. I just did that. I:\tThat was what it was. R:\tYeah. I:\tHow long were the anger management classes? Tell me about  Just tell me your experience with anger management. R:\tI went for two months, every weekend. It was cool. It was weird. The people inside there was weird. I:\tHow so? R:\tThey be just talking  I dont know. Its hard to describe. The dude, when somebody is asking you are you madlike every ten minutes, asking you how you feel or asking are you angry? Thats when I get angry. Thats just going to make you upset, so I had to deal with that. I dont know if he was just testing me, or what it was. But I had to deal with that. No, yes, Im fine. Just leave me alone. Im fine. Dont ask me that. Im fine.  I dont know. I mean, I didnt open up that much. I didnt open up at all in anger management class. I just did the  did what I had to do, the time I had to do, and got done with it. I:\tDid you find it was helpful at all? R:\tUmm  a little bit, yeah. They taught me different methods to calm myself down. Little things to do to kind of calm myself down, or places I could go. Like, walk away and do this and do that. Yeah, it did. I:\tAnd youve used those things that you learned? R:\tTo this day, yeah. I write  when I get mad, I write. When I [inaudible 72:42] to the point where I cant take it no more, I just start writing. Whatever comes out, just comes out. And I burn the paper. I:\tReally? R:\tYeah. Cant nobody read it. Only I know what it is, so burning it is likeI wrote it out, I got it out of my system. Now its gone. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Do you feel better after you do that? R:\tYeah. I:\tYeah, yeah. Remind me again how many weeks the class was? The anger management class. R:\tTwo months, every weekend. I:\tOkay. You met for two hours or something like that? . R:\tYeah, about two hours every single day. No longer than two hours. I:\tYou had to pay every time you would go? R:\tYeah. I:\tOnce you finished the two months worth of classes, then you were done with pretrial diversion? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat were the conditions with regards to taking the anger management class? If you completed the anger management class, that meant that you didnt have to go back? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat did you get for completing it? R:\tIf I didnt complete it, I had to eventually go back to jail. I could complete this, or I could complete that. If I dont complete this, Im going for [inaudible 74:05] that. So, yeahI had to complete it. I had no choice not to complete it. I:\tHow much jail time were you looking at? R:\tIt might have been a whole year, but nothing longer than a whole year. I:\tSo this was kind of easy? R:\tYeah. I:\tJust do these two months. And youre going to be on probation for three years? R:\tUh-huh [yes]. May I ask you how long this going to take? I:\tI think were  We just have maybe 20 more minutes to go. R:\tAll right, yeah. I just trying to get there at 4:30. I:\tYou need to go somewhere by 4:30? What time is it now? R:\tIts only 3:30. I:\tOkay. I think we should be good and I can get you back. The thing is, I dont want to ask you questions that youve already answered in our conversation. Ill just go through this again.  Okay. How much did you feel that taking the anger management class helped to reduce your odds of reoffending? Not at all? Some? Quite a bit? R:\tUmm  somewhat, I guess. Because I didnt want to be back in jail. [Inaudible 75:46] bring me to a point where I had to go back in the situation I was already in. I:\tLet me ask it this way, then. If you didnt take the anger management class, do you R:\tI probably would be back in jail. I:\tYou would have? R:\tYeah. I:\tYou would not have been able to deal with R:\tControl my anger. I:\tSo it was helpful? R:\tYeah, of course it was helpful. I:\tOkay, so somewhat, but not quite a bit. R:\tYeah, not all the way. I:\tYeah. A lot of it for you was your motivation R:\tTo not go back. Yeah, exactly. Yes, yes. Yes, not to go back. Thats not new. My only motivation is not to  find myself in a position where Im in the back of a police car no more. Straight up. Thats not for me. Its not who I am. Its not how I was raised, not my character. I:\tYeah. R:\tYeah, its not for me. Id probably die in that thing. I wouldnt be able to do it at all. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Youve said a few times that its not your character. Do you mind telling me, just for a minute, telling me about your character. When you think about who [Name] is. R:\tIm very happy, goofy, funny. Im an athlete. I love kids, love family. Now Im the type of person that is trying to learn how to deal with a lot of people. I know how to work with people, so I like meeting new people. I like trying new things, seeing new things. Im very adventurous. You could ask me to jump off something and I might look at it. I be likeif I fall, that might hurt, but I still might do it to see what it is. I still might do it just to see if I can do it. You tell me I cant do something? Im going to do it just because you said I cant do it. Dont tempt me; dont challenge me to do something because if you challenge me, then Im going to meet that challenge and youre going to be mad because Im going to win that challenge. I dont know. Im very goofy, outspoken. I just very happy person now. Very responsible. Im respectful. My mom raised me to have respect for all adults, no matter how they get you. No matter how they come at you. Respect for adults. Now Im big on family. Im very big on family. I think thats number one. You got to have a solid foundation to have yourself got solid. I:\tDo you want to have kids when you get older? R:\tI want to have one kid. I want to have a kid, but I dont really want to have to have intercourse with a male to get pregnant. Thats one thing I dont want to do. If thats what I have to do then I guess I will not be having no kids. I:\tYeah. There are other ways, but ... R:\tYeah, I was told, I was told. Yeah. I:\tOkay. So you said you dont remember how much it cost you to participate? R:\tI think it was $50 a day, for each class. I:\t$50 for each class? Wow. R:\tI remember, my mama had to pay some of it. I:\tLoan you some money. R:\tYeah, at the end of the classes. I:\tThats a lot for each class. R:\tYeah! You know what I can do with $50 every single day? I:\tI just was saying. R:\tI can get me some shoes, everything. Food, mostly important. It get me food. I love food. I:\tOkay, let me get this down. Im really surprised that it was that much. R:\tYeah, I dont think it shouldnt have been that much. I think theyre just trying to get the extra money in their pockets. I:\tI think thats exactly right. Sometimes though, what they sometimes do is have a sliding scale so that people can  you know, if you cant afford it. Were you able to afford it? If so, how? You said your mom. R:\tYeah, my mama helped me. Yeah, I dont understand they try to have me pay for something that I didnt want to be at myself. You got to pay for something I:\tYou have to do it, and then you have to pay to do it. R:\tYeah. I:\tIt wasnt waived or reduced in any way? R:\tNah. I:\tOkay. Did you have to go to every single class, or you would have to start over? R:\tYeah, I couldnt miss more than three classes. I:\tIf you did then you were going back. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tWere there any other special conditions associated with your participation? R:\tI just had to go to the classes, stay out of trouble. I:\tHow did they choose anger management? R:\tThey said I had anger problems. Thats the reason I was fighting, I guess. Because like I said, its assault. I guess they figured I had anger problems, but I dont think I had anger problems. I:\tYeah. Solely based on what happened that led to your arrest is why they were saying that. R:\tYeah. I:\tThey taught you the techniques and they also gave you suggestions about what you could do when you start to get angry, like go for a walk or write your feelings down and burn the paper. Were there other things that they taught you, or suggested that you could do in order to address the anger? R:\tTalk it out. Basically, express how I feel. I try to express myself in a way to where Im not yelling, and Im not coming off as such an angry person. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Has anyone else told you that theyve seen a difference in you? R:\tMy mama, of course. She told me shes very proud of how Ive grown and who Ive become over the past years. I mean, I see it, but then again I dont see it. Plus, I still doubt myself sometimes here and there. Her, and my girl actually always remind me of who I was back then and who I am now. Im better than I was yesterday, basically. I:\tYeah, yeah. Thats what we all can strive for, right? In terms of supervision during probation, you said you had to check in at first every week and then every two weeks. Was there anything else you had to do? R:\tRandom drug tests. I had to make sure I do drug tests. Yeah, I had to check in just to make sure I came to school. I didnt graduate high school, so I had to finish. [Inaudible 82:10 ] to get my GED. Actually, they pushed me to get my GED, so I guess thats a good thing I guess. Because I actually got it now. I dont think I would have it if they wouldnt have been pushing me to get it. I had to get my GED program, anger management, and stay out of trouble. I:\tYou didnt tell me about the situation that led to you dropping out of school. Was it after you lost the scholarship? R:\tYeah, I didnt go back after that. I didnt go back to school after that. I went back a couple months  I was 19, going on 20, when I got my GED. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tI ended up going to Merritt College right after that. I:\tWere there any other benefits that you got from participating, in terms of your personal relationships, employment, education, legal troubles? R:\tThey helped me get in school. That was a good thing. They helped me enroll in college. They helped me get financial aid for it, so I get my books and stuff. Other than that, no not really. I:\tThats not bad. R:\tYeah, my probation officer, she was a good lady. I wouldnt say she was-  Yeah, she was a PO, but she was more of a mentor and trying to help better me and get myself out that predicament than anything. She actually drove me up to the school house. She got on me when I didnt do right, but she make sure I was on my stuff. I:\tSo in general, you feel like you had a pretty decent relationship with her? R:\tYeah. I:\tThat she was behind you. R:\tIts a love/hate relationship. Id get mad at her for yelling at me. Talking about why are you yelling at me? I dont want to do that. And shed be likeno, you need to do this. You need to go to school. Why you aint at school today [Name]? [Inaudible 84:06], come there, she come to my school and make sure Im there. She pushed me a lot, to where I come home and she be at my front door, waiting for me to get home. I:\tReally? R:\tYeah. [Laugh] I thought it was weird at first, but I see why she did it now. I understand everything she did now. I didnt understand it back then, but I understand it now. If she didnt do it, actually I probably wouldnt have did my GED. I probably would never even have went to college like I have. I:\tYeah, it sounds like she really invested in you and cared about you. R:\tLike I said, thats my first adult offense besides the juvenile case. I wasnt  I mean, [inaudible 84:42] see something in me that I didnt see. I:\tKind of like your mother. R:\tYeah, I guess. Now that I think of it, yeah. Its crazy. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tYeah. I never thought of it like that. I:\tWhen you were taking anger management classes, were there other program participants that you got to know as a result of the class? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tSo you started no friendships or anything in that situation. Can you tell me about any staff from that program that you interacted with? R:\tThey tried to get me to talk to them. I was a very private person. They tried to get me to open up and talk to them, but I didnt make relationships with them.  I:\tBesides the, Are you mad? Are you mad? That was kind of the extent of it? R:\tYeah, yeah. Yeah, she asked me am I mad or upset? Like, for what? I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? In the anger management class? R:\tNo, just its boring. I got sleepy a lot. I:\tAny violations? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I made sure of that. I:\tWhat were you told that you needed to do in order to complete the program successfully? R:\tShow up. I:\tThats it, and dont miss more than three classes. You were able to meet those obligations. R:\tYeah, my mom made sure I didnt miss a class. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Did she take you? R:\tUh huh! [Yes] [Laugh] I:\tYou know, [Name], the more we talk its likeso you had your mom and then there was the woman in jail who saw you and reached out and gave you the bible. R:\tHer name is April. Miss April I:\tAnd then there was your probation officer. R:\tMiss Jackson. I:\tThere are these women who are reaching out. It just feels like they  You have a few angels kind of, in your life, you know? I shouldnt be saying this because this is supposed to be an academic interview, but there are these  I could see why you would say earlier in the interview that you have a lot of people who support you. R:\tYeah, I do. I aint thought about that, but I do have a lot of angels in my life. Youre right. I do. In disguise, at that. Theyre in disguise. I:\tRight. Theyre kind of pains in your butt sometimes, but they do some good stuff too. R:\tMy mama, she never made me  Yeah, she would not let me miss a class at all. She would come in my room and make me get out of bed. It dont matter if Im dressed or not. I could have on this right here and I still go. She didnt care. I:\tRight. If she didnt do that, do you think you wouldve missed? R:\tOf course. I was lazy. I didnt want to get out of my bed, especially on a Saturday. Saturday morning, you want me out of my bed to go to the official anger management class? I dont do none of that. She made me do it, so I guess it worked out for the best. I:\tWhen the anger management class was over, did you celebrate that? What did you do to acknowledge that it was done? R:\tWhen it was over, I was happy. I told my PO, likeIm done with it. I aint got to do it no more. Now I just focused on getting my GED then. Thats the only thing I did. I went from focusing on anger management class to focusing on my education. I:\tRight, okay. To what extent do you agree with the following? Overall the program was very helpful. Strongly agree? Agree? Neutral? Strongly disagree? Disagree? R:\tIt was helpful. I:\tOkay, so strongly or just agree? R:\tAgree. I:\tWhat did you feel was particularly helpful? R:\tTeaching me how to control my anger was number one. I:\tGiving you those techniques? R:\tYeah, and strength and the courage I got to control myself. Cant nobody control me but me. I:\tYeah, and that was the big thing you learned? R:\tYeah. I:\tWas there anything that you found very unhelpful about the program? R:\tNo, not really. No. I mean, everything I do, I take something good out of it. I got to take something positive out of every situation. Whether it was bad or not. I:\tDespite the fact that it was boring sometimes, it was still worth going to because of what you learned? R:\tYeah. I:\tWould you recommend the program to others? R:\tIf they really need it, yeah. I:\tIs there anything that the program needs to do to better address the clients that they deal with? R:\tUmm  more organized I should say. I:\tWhat do you mean? R:\tMany times, they had their files  The paperwork and stuff wasnt organized. They cant find certain paperwork they needed. If it was organized  They were always respectful. Always had respect and treated each other with kindness. It just wasnt organized. Yeah, just [inaudible 89:57] with papers everywhere. They couldnt find the paper they needed, or they had to go somewhere and make a copy of certain paper to give it to everybody else because they didnt have enough papers. It wasnt organized. Just little things like that. Other than that, it was fine. I:\tI think if I had that experience, I wouldve been frustrated. How did it make you feel that you had to deal with them losing the papers? R:\tYeah, its frustrating, because it seemed like it wasting my time. Im here, do this and do that, and yall aint even on point with yall jobs. I:\tRight. [Laugh] I have lots of experiences like that. Okay, so this is the final section. I think its going to be relatively short because so much of your life was pretty stable after you were released. When you think about the day that you were releasedthat first day that you were releasedafter those first two weeks. Can you walk me through how that felt to be out? R:\tIt was joy. [Laugh] I swear, it was joy. The first thing I did was go home, take a shower, and eat. The first thing I did was go home and eat. I went to McDonalds and ate a big old Big Mac. For real. Got home, got in the shower. My mom ended up me my favorite food, chicken and rice. I love rice. She cooked chicken and rice. I ate. Friends, family came over, seeing how I was doing. I stayed in the house that whole day because I just got out. I wanted to sit down and relax in my own bed, know what Im saying? I:\tRight, yeah. R:\tTake a long shower, eat a whole lot of food. I was happy to be home. As long as I able to be with my mom. I aint never remember her that lonely in my life. I was happy to be back around her. I dont know, I dont like separations from my mom at all. That was a long time, so I just wanted to be with her that whole time. I was happy just to run into her arms like a big old little girl. Just wanted to be around her. She couldnt get rid of me that day. She was probably irritated with me, but she had to deal with it. I wasnt going nowhere. I:\tDo you think she was really irritated? R:\tNo, I dont think she was irritated. She probably was just like, give her some spacelike back up a little bit, but I dont think she was irritated. I know she was happy to see me. I know she missed me just as much I missed her. I:\tYeah. You said that a lot of people came by to see you, too. Who came by to see you? R:\tMy best friends, my dad, my sisters and cousins. My girlfriend. She had [inaudible 92:21 when I got out of jail. She was there when I got out of jail. Her and my mom picked me up from the jail house. Yeah, just some close friends that I know. My three best friends came. Like I said, my father and my grandmother. My cousins. Just tightknit. Not too many people knew I had got out. They didnt know I got out until after I showed my face around. It was nobodys business. Only people who knew were the certain people I wanted to know. I:\tThe ones you felt really close to. R:\tYeah. The ones that I had felt needed to know that I was out. Aint nobodys business I was out. I did want to scream for joy to the whole world I was out, though. [Laugh] I did, I did. I:\tWere there any tough adjustments that you had to make after you were released? R:\tTrying to get a job. That was the number one, trying to get a job. That was the number one thing. Like I said, my background, they seen that and they sit aside and judge. They cant judge me off of my background, not know me for who I was. Know what Im saying? That for real was the number one struggle right there. Finding a job. I:\tWhat was the first job that you got after you got out? R:\t[Inaudible 93:34 ]. I:\tHow long did you go without a job? R:\tI been a long time without a job. My girlfriend supported me for a long time. I:\tThat must have been hard. R:\tYeah, it was very depressing. Yeah, basically I just got a job this February. So it was very, very depressing. I wanted to turn back into things that I know, you know what Im saying? I can go out and do this and do that, and make this and make that. This [inaudible 94:04] amount of money.  But I kept thinking about me going to jail. Me being in that place again. Me doing this and that; if I do this Im going to end up doing that. So that stopped me. And then my girlfriend, [Name], shes encouraged me not to do it a whole lot, too. Even though she was supporting both of usand probably was hard, but she didnt let me see how hard it was for her. If I needed it, she got it. I [inaudible 94:28] because I know we struggling. My mama, she helped out when she can, but Im too independent to ask for anything. My girl, shes likeI got you; dont worry about it. But it was a very depressed stage for me to get out of. Because I always take care of myself. I had to depend on somebody else to take care of me. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I could see why that would be really hard. R:\tYeah, but I got through it though. I got through it. I:\tIt sounds like a good part of getting through it was having her say I got you. R:\tYeah, her support. I did not work for a long time. A full minute. I:\tThat must have been a relief, to get the job that you have now. R:\tOf course, of course. It was a relief because I learned something new too, at the same time. I never worked in a kitchen before, so they gave me  they [inaudible 95:21] gave me the opportunity to learn and to grow and to build myself. So I appreciated that. I:\tFollowing your release, how did you support yourself financially? It sounds like support from family, and specifically your girlfriend. And now you support yourself. R:\tI support myself, yeah. I:\tFor each of the following, Id like to know if you had access to programs or services that helped with this issue? Im just going to go through it because I think I know the answers to these questions. I dont think you got help trying to find a place to live. R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tNor finding a job? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tTransportation? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tContinuing your education, though? R:\tYeah, I did. I:\tChild care? R:\tNo. I:\tLegal assistance? R:\tNo. I:\tGetting drug or alcohol treatment? R:\tNo. I:\tAccessing healthcare? R:\tNo. I:\tGetting counseling? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Getting financial assistance? R:\tNo. I:\tObtaining a photo ID? R:\tI have my ID, the PO gave me my ID. I:\tOkay. Working on personal relationships? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Anything else? Okay. Are there any other programs that you wish were offered once you got out, that you didnt have access to? R:\tYeah, a program for a job. I:\tTo help find one. Yeah. R:\tYeah, to help find jobs. Knowing how hard it is out here, but yeah, something to help find jobs. I:\tDid your detention in any way affect your relationships with your family members? Make them worse? R:\tMy little sister. It kind of did with my little sister. I wouldnt say she looks at me differently, but she did. Im kind of glad she did because shes not falling in the  the same hole that I fell in. I [inaudible 97:29] rather she dont follow me. Im kind of happy she didnt, and she did that.  But it [hurts? 97:36], you know? Were not close as we was no more, but now we are. When we was younger we wasnt, because she wasnt into the things I was into. She was likenah. Yeah, she was the good one. She didnt want to do the things I was doing. Thats what Im happy about. She thought for herself and not follow behind what I was doing. I:\tHow did that  You must have felt bad, though. R:\tI mean, of course I felt bad. I felt real bad. Because like I said, she was looking at me. She looking at me like she do it and I got in trouble. Its likeI dont want to do all that. I dont want to do what youre doing. She didnt look up to me no more. Thats the part that really was hurting me the most. I:\tHow is she doing now? R:\tMy little sister, shes doing very good right now. She just came home from a college tour. I:\tWow. R:\tYeah. She did a college tour, shes working two jobs. Yeah, Im very proud of her. Very, very proud of her. I:\tWhat colleges did she go to tour? R:\tShe went to Clark, Howard, Spellman. The college tour down south. I cant  Morehouse, [Newport? 98:44]. A lot of colleges she went to. I:\tEast coast. R:\tYeah, I know she applied for [Newport? 98:51]. I know she did that. She doing good. Im just proud of her that she didnt take the route I went down. That shes taking a better route that I thought I took for myself. I:\tSeeing her do this, this is what you were thinking about five years ago. R:\tYeah, exactly. Its something that I could have been doing, but I didnt take the  I had the opportunity to do it, but I messed it up by getting into a brawl. Im just happy that she didnt do that. She didnt do what I did. Im just happy. Shes going to school for criminal justice, too. I:\tRight. So shes interested in those issues now. R:\tYeah. Im just proud of her. Im very proud of her. I:\tShes going into her senior year now? R:\tNo, she just graduated high school. Yeah, last year. Shes in her first year of college. I:\tOkay, good for her. So in terms of the kinds of support that your family members have provided you over the last couple of years. None? Financial? Housing? You can check off  And for each of these, can you just give me a snippet of how they have helped?  R:\tFinancial; my mom and my girl, they always be there for me if I didnt have it. My mom, housing. I live with my mom to this day. Emotional, when [inaudible 100:18] make sure Im all right. Yeah. Temptation. My mom and my girlfriend, if I go somewhere, I [inaudible 100:25. I:\tDo you have your drivers license yet? R:\tNo, Im working on it now. I:\tOkay. Did your detention affect your relationships with friends at all? R:\tNo. I:\tWhat types of support did your friends provide, if any of those? R:\tI would say emotional more than anything. I:\tDo you want to give me an example of the kind of emotional support that you got from them? R:\tLike I said, when I was down in my dumps and I didnt have no job, they [inaudible 101:11] to go and do stuff. The people who was still in the streets encouraged me not to be in the streets. I thought that was real. How you telling me not to do something? I:\tWhat are you doing? R:\tYeah, yeah. You doing it yourself right now. Im saying, but somebodythey encouraged me not to go back down that road. Know what Im saying? That was big for them and big for me, that they could like  Let me go ahead and do it. I:\tWhat was the reasoning behind them telling you to get out? R:\tThey knew me. They knew that thats where I  [inaudible 101:54]. They also know that thats not what I wanted. For me, thats me not wanting that made more sense than me doing it. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. When you were running around with your brotherI know that you were drawn to being with himwas there anything that you liked about what you all did together? R:\tThe money. The money, straight up. The money was nice. The money was coming in fast and easy. If I knew what I know now, what I know back then, I would have done it differently. Back then, I had it. If I wanted it, I go get it. I could go to the store and buy anything I want to go buy. I didnt have to have mom give me nothing. I was giving her money. It was just that easy, that quick. I got accustomed to me getting easy money. Straight up. I miss it, but at the same time I dont miss that jail cell, straight up. I:\tYeah. In the past when Ive interviewed people, this was almost always guysin the early years they would try things and the money was fine. Then of course, theres the women and whatever. But they would almost talk about it like it was a high. There was almost a high to the lifestyle itself. R:\tYeah, of course. You feel good doing it. You feel high doing it. Okay, yep. I feel good I did this. I feel like Im the man; I just did this. You walking around with your head held high. Even though it might be bad, knowing you just did something. Yeah, its you. Cant nobody take that high from you. Cant nobody take that joy that you got from doing this. Straight up. I:\tAnd you did that with your brother and you two were close. R:\tYeah. I:\tNow Im going to ask you just a few questions about housing, then the debt, and then were done. How many places did you live the first year following your release from jail? R:\tTwo. I:\tYour mother and your girlfriend? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tHow would you describe your housing situation immediately after your release? You lived  Your familys house, Im assuming. R:\tMy mom. Yeah, I lived in my mamas house. I:\tOkay. What were the pros and cons of living with your mom? R:\tThe pros was I had somewhere to live. The cons was that I had somebody I had to listen to. I:\tWas that really bad? R:\tI mean  nah, some of it wasnt bad. Some of it was. Depending on how I take it because Im just a child. I dont  My mama. Of course, Im going to have a problem with her telling me to do something that I dont want to do. I mean it wasnt really a problem. It just me being her daughter, and me not wanting to listen to what she saying. And about her being a parent, she aint going to allow no disrespect or nothing like that to happen in her household. Especially coming from her child. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. That was the cons. What were the pros? What are the good things about being with your mom then? R:\tThe pros? I live rent free. I dont pay rent. I:\tDid you want to say more? R:\tYeah, I got my family. Around my family. I:\tYour situation today, are you still living with your mom? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Yeah, Im back and forth from my mom and my girl. I:\tOkay. Im assuming its the same pros and cons because your moms not going to change. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Yeah. Nah, shes not going to change at all. I:\tSince you were released, have you had any trouble finding a place to live because of your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tNo. I:\tYour first month out, was the place that you stayed safe? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tYou strongly agree or agree? R:\tI strongly agree. I:\tWas it hard to stay out of trouble in your neighborhood when you first got out? R:\tOf course. I:\tIt was hard? R:\tYes. I:\tWere you nervous about seeing certain people in your neighborhood? R:\tNo. I:\tStrongly disagree, or just disagree? R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tDrug selling is a problem in your neighborhood? R:\tOf course it is. I:\tDo you think your neighborhood is a good place to live? R:\tIts a good place to live. Just bad people in it. I:\tOkay, so agree? Strongly agree? R:\tAgree. I:\tDo you care about what your neighbors think about you? R:\tOf course, yeah. I:\tIf there was a neighborhood, people living in the neighborhood, could they come together to resolve the problem? R:\tI hope so, yeah. I:\tAgree or strongly? R:\tAgree. I:\tAnd you expect to live in your neighborhood for a long time? R:\tAgree. I:\tOkay. Agree or strongly agree? R:\tStrongly agree. I aint planning on moving. I:\tSo youre in the same neighborhood so Ill just go over the same responses. And with regards to housing, do you plan on staying with your girlfriend? Your mom? I mean, what do you think for your future? R:\tMe and my girl are trying to get a spot together. We trying to find an apartment right now. I:\tAn apartment together? Are you both working now? R:\tYeah. I:\tAre you going to stay in the same neighborhood? R:\tTrying to. I:\tIs your mom close by? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnything else you want to talk about with regards to housing? R:\tNo. I:\tThis is asking about your job situation. Because we talked about it, I know the answers to it. When you were unemployed, how many hours each week would you say that you searched for work? Like one to five? Six to ten? Sometimes people search for work like its a full time job. How many hours per week? R:\tMaybe between  Id try, but then when I got discouraged, I stopped. I:\tI think that that happens a lot. Especially early on, you really put in a lot of effort, but then you feel like it goes down once you feel like you dont get much hits. R:\tYeah. It gets discouraging. I:\tYeah. I know your girlfriend was helping you, trying to keep your mood up, but how do you  When weeks became months, and months became years.  R:\tI just keep just pushing myself. I think if I dont get no job now, then I aint never going to get one. Straight up. If I dont get one sooner than later, then what? I:\tWhen are you going to get one? Yeah. R:\tExactly. I:\tThats what I was wondering. I think in part, thats why I keep asking how you felt. Because I think after a while you just feel like  R:\tI was depressed. Yeah, I was very depressed. I was in the house at all times. I had to hit up my girl for money and food. I was just depressed. I feel like I was useless to myself. I couldnt help myself. I didnt have a pot to piss in. I couldnt help myself. I was feeling helpless, very helpless. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Did it help when you were going, when you were taking classes at the community college? Because then you were in college. R:\tYeah, I was doing something. I was actually doing something, so yeah. I mean, it helped, but it still wasnt no job. I:\tRight, right. R:\tIt helped because I was bettering myself. It helped because I was bettering my future, but at the same time I wasnt helping at that moment in time. I:\tYeah. How much effort would you say you expended in your search? A lot? Some? A little? None? R:\tI could say some. I:\tOkay. It sounded like initially it was a lot, and then it tailed off. R:\tYeah, it went down. I:\tWhat kind of methods did you use to find work? Friends? Contacted an agency? R:\tYeah, job fairs, friends. I did resumes. I walked in places. All that. I:\tContacted them directly, too. Okay. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo you tried everything. You felt like having a criminal record made it very difficult for you to find R:\tYeah, of course. I:\tAnd where do you see yourself in terms of work and employment in the next year? Five years? Ten years? R:\tBetter than what Im doing now, and hopefully looking to get my own house. I:\tYou said that you had incurred some debt because of your contact with the criminal justice system. R:\tYeah, the restitution. You just had to pay that off. Its paid off now, but I had to pay it off when I got out of jail. I:\tHow much did you pay? How much was the total? R:\t$150. It wasnt that much. I:\tHow much were you paying each month when you were paying it? R:\tI paid it off all at once. I didnt try to prolong it. I:\tSome people dont have $150 to pay, so they  R:\tNo, I didnt have it. Youre right, I didnt. My mom and my girlfriend had it. I:\tHave you experienced any of the following because of your criminal justice debt? Been to court? Been reincarcerated? Violated? Had your drivers license revoked? Wages garnished? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tThis is because you paid it all off. R:\tThat same. Yeah, I had nothing. I:\tOkay. In general, how would you say the criminal justice obligations have affected your life? The restitution? R:\tIts a good and bad way. The good way because it made me better myself. The bad way, I went to jail. At the same time though, its a good experience because it made me better myself. I:\tYeah. With regards to the restitution itself, did you have to pay your mom back? Did you have to do any of those things in order to deal with that? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I didnt have to pay her back. I:\tOkay. The final question is, is there anything else that is important to you, or that is going on in your life right now that weve not talked about that you want to share before we call this a day? R:\tNo, not really. Everybody is [inaudible 112:51] something. No matter what your skin color is. No matter ethnicity, race, male, female, same preference [inaudible 112:59] sexuality. Everybody is equals in my head. I dont know.  A lot of this stuff going on here in the world period. Not only in Oakland, but in the world period, that shouldnt be going down. I just wish that everybody get together because at the end of the day, its only   Were the next generation. The next generation. What else can you say about that? Its up to us, man. Its out of our parents hands. Its up to us to make that change, not them. Because we got the younger generation looking at us. Im saying, then they just looking at them. Its a chain of command. I dont know. I:\tHave you been doing anything with regards to Black Lives Matter, or those kind of things? Have you been out in the protests? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I dont want to get caught up in the mess with the police. I:\tThis is your effort to  R:\tYeah, thats it. I:\tNo, I appreciate that very much. [Name], at this point do you have any questions for me? R:\tNo, I dont. I:\tOkay. I might have to ask if you could get some contact information. Some of the things that weve talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable. Were there any topics or questions that you thought were particularly uncomfortable? Or that you think might be asked more effectively? Any issues with any of that? Sometimes when I conduct studies, I like to get not just your contact information, which I have, but someone in your family or someone whos close to you. If I want to contact you later, you might change your number, or address. R:\tOkay, no problem. This number aint going nowhere. I had it for ten years already. I:\tYou had this number for ten years? Are you serious? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. Ill trust that youre going to keep it then. A lot of people dont have it for that long. Let me stop this.

I:\tSomewhat agree? R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\tOkay. Do you want to tell me R:\t[Inaudible 5:08] I came out here. I was born and raised in San Francisco, but I was raised in Portland, Oregon for 15 years. So three years ago I came back because my mom was dying of some cancer, and she was in her last stage. So I came back to help her. And her and my grandmother just so happen to pass  you know, they died a month apart. And I was only here for that, for then. And it messed up the whole month of February, you know? When my mom passed. Which CPS came and got my daughter. So it was a lot.  So I was only here [inaudible 5:39] now with my daughter since my mom passed. But CPS just recentlylike two weeks agosent her to Philadelphia. I:\tWho is she staying with in Philadelphia? R:\tA group home. So thats why  Im in the middle of that. So as far as family, its justits just me. You know, I used to have aunties and cousins, and whatnot. But its not the same since my mom passed. Its just different. So I do a lot by myself. And I have an auntie who helps me. So its just I:\tIs that your moms sister? R:\tShes her  not biological. My grandma took her in when she was young, and raised her like her own. But thatsand thats what makes it so hard. Because shes not my biological auntie, you know what I mean? I:\tYeah. R:\tBut it just the fact, though, that she is still there. Shes still, you know, play a major part.  I:\tTrying to help you get through. R:\tRight. Right. So at the moment its just me. So when it comes to family Ill be somewhat  interested in basically but  I:\tCan I call you [name]? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo where is the rest of your family members? Where are they? R:\tTheyre allwell, my siblings; its six of us altogether. Three boys, three girls. Im the oldest girl. The oldest, well four of us was in Portland and two of us in California. I just found them  When my mom passed I just found them. It was adopted out. But she [inaudible 7:01] we did  I did a lot of working and I was able to meet my little brother and my little sister. Shes not ready to meet as yet. But we can be staying in contact. But my aunties and uncles just spread out through the Bayview district and Sunset. Were all  were scattered here. But its just empty. I can have something, an anniversary for my mom passingI could throw a big dinner, and [inaudible 7:28] family, just my auntie and her kids will come. And Ill be likeokay, there somebody is going to come. Anybody is going to. You know what I mean?  My momma had all together, her kids  her siblings are like eight of them. And its two passed, but its just  yeah. I:\tIt feels very kind of R:\tDistant. Yeah. So thats why I always tell people like everybody leave me just with myself. Why dont I ever see nobody come to your house? Its just me. And it be kind of sad, you know? Lonely, though. I:\tOf course it is. R:\tBecause who you know [inaudible 8:01] need advice and stuff. And who can I call? I:\tRight. Right. And do you have some sense about how your siblings are doing? Are they doing okay? Are they stable? Do you have any idea? R:\tWe have  I have a good relationship with my older sister, the one in Oregon. We have like a special bond out of this world. My older brother, he just got out of jail about three years ago from doing eight and a-half. So were still getting on the track to know him all over again. When my grandmother and my mother passed one of my little brothers [inaudible 8:36] drugs real heavy. Drugs, alcohol. Like real, real heavy. So by the grace of god he just went to a program. So hes in the program for 90 days. And then I can see hell get out here and go back. So we got hope for that.  I:\tYeah. R:\tAnd my little brother out here, hes in Turlock. He got adopted. Before my mom passed away the lady came and asked my mom, you know [inaudible 9:00] blessings. We gave them blessings. The caucasian lady who adopted him, he love it. We still keep in contact. [Inaudible 9:08] the baby one. It just  I dont know. Its different. Shes in the family on her dads side. She didnt get adopted out like my little brother. His sisterher dads sisterhad adopted her. But the story the lady told about my mom and just us, periodfor the longest time she thought we were all dead. She didnt know she had siblings.  I:\tRight. R:\tSo when I reached out and I found her, she thought I was lyingyou know, a con person. So Im sending her all these pictures. And we look so much alike it was scary. I:\tShe cant deny it.  R:\tAnd then on the phone we talk. And if we get to that point where we get mad we soundits just crazy. So she aint ready for that. [Laugh]. Shes not ready to meet us. Which is fine. Its no pressure. I know shes in Antioch. Thats all shes said. So its fine. Its fine. She graduated from high school, which Im fine with that. Shes a little nurse now at the hospital. So you know, as long as I keep in contact with everyonethats fine. But like my dad, he dont call for nothing. Hell call if he sees my little brother at the [inaudible 10:14]. You know how a parent will just call your phone and say, Hi, how you doing? You know? No. So for fathers day I didnt even reach out. Because I was likewell, youre my dad and you dont call me. So Im not going to call you on this one special day. I:\tRight. R:\tIts just been  it hurt, though. Because I only have one parent left. And I cherish him a lot. I:\tBut hes not He doesnt seem to be all that interested R:\tRight. You ever met an old person who swore theyre still young? Like dont miss the club scene and dont You know what I mean? Literally dont miss the club scene. Instead hes doing the old dances and trying to fit in, hell be like. But you have over ten grandkids right now. [Sigh] Oh, it be frustrating. Frustrating, frustrating. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tSo I dont know. My son lives in Oregon and [inaudible 11:02] see him. My dad is in Oregon. My sisters in Oregon. Why dont you all go get my son? You know what I mean? Have that relationship. They dont. So its just making it, like I saidand when my son gets older hes already going to feel some kind of way about me. But its going to be more I:\tThe whole family [inaudible 11:17]. R:\tRight. Hes not going to have one person, like this. Its just going to be likeforget yallyall [inaudible 11:20]? You know? And I dont want that. But its happening. Its already happening. I:\tDo you get a chance to call him often? R:\tBoy, thats the thing. He had a phone. And we were communicating for a while. His dad found out and took the phone. So my son, he started to make him a facebook. And we were talking on facebook. Dad found out, and he got in trouble. So I havent talked to my son in a long time.  I:\tSo his father doesnt want him to have a relationship with you right now? R:\tBasically. Yeah. And I couldnt even tell you why. But its I havent had my son in my life since he was four. I:\tAnd how old is he now? This is the one about to turn 13? R:\tYeah.  I:\tSo for nine years youve not had a Yeah, that must be tough. I could see why you would want to R:\tEven when I go to Oregon. People dont understand. I know Oregon. I love Oregon and everything. But its hard for me to go back, because I cant see my son. Its a process. Like I said, and my siblings and my dad can see my son. And so trying to get them to go over to my baby daddys house I:\tRight. R:\tIts like trying to get a dog to put a dress on, on a good day. Its not going to work. So I just be likeoh, man. My family is like, Why dont you come see us? Come for what? Ill be so depressed. Ill be carrying. There are so many memories. And Ill be looking at yall with yall kids, and I cant do it. The last time I was thereI was there three years agoand I was out there for a week; I was there for a week because my sister was getting married. I ended up staying for two and a-half weeks. Then my baby daddy kept saying, You can see your son, but he was just prolonging it. And we kept getting into it. All of a sudden, why do you want to see  you know? But just  It was hectic. So the day of me leaving I saw my son. So it made me sad, you know? But it was just  it was good, but it wasnt good. I:\tYeah. R:\tBecause my son didnt treat me like I thought. It was more so he was talking, and he was playing my sisters daughterwhich is his cousin. And they were playing. He did something to her, and she started crying. So I said, [Son], you better stop if I make you cry. His facial expression was just  it was  man, it was like I had [boo-boo? 13:24] on my face. He laughed at me, and was like, What? Because you think you had me you my mom? You better get out of my face, lady. So I was just  that took me to a place likeoh my god. Like, Im losing my son. I lost him. You know? That hurted. Like, that hurted.  For mothers day he had called and was like  it was like  I think it was 8:00 or 9:00. I was likewell, dang, Im glad I was on your mind. He was likewell, we had went out. I said, [Son], where was you at? He was like we [inaudible 14:04] picking up his girlfriend, or whatever; we went out with my grandma and everything. I was like okay, but umm  whatever [inaudible 14:10]. He was likeyeah, you cant be mad because you aint even my mom like that. Im likewhat? Hes like, my first mom is [name], which is his grandmother. My first mom is [name]. And my second mom is [name], which is my baby daddys other babys momma. And hes likeand youre my third mom. So you cant be mad. Thats your fault. I:\tRight. R:\tI could [inaudible 14:31] hang up. I was just likewhoa. Oh my god. But I told him I was [inaudible 14:38] about this baby. His response wasand I like I said it before, I cant be mad at my son. I cant do nothing but respect it, because hes at that age. I cant do nothing but respect it, and listen. I told him I was pregnant. It was an unplanned pregnancy. I didnt know I was pregnant until I was like ten and a-half weeks, or whatever. So I told my son. And hes likeso why are you having the baby? Because I wanted the baby. I [inaudible 15:00] my baby. Hes likebut you let people take your other kids. So why would you have him? Hes likemy dad took me, the white people took [name] and [inaudible] dad took her. So youre going to have another baby so some people could take him?  I:\tRight. R:\tThat was  that affected me so much. And it still  whew. Oh my god. That eats me up like crazy. Just to hear your child say that to you. And you know theres some truth into that. But its your child. Not another adult, having a conversation with you, you know? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tSo, oh. Yeah. My daughter I had last yearFebruary 19 her dad decided to take her. I call it a kidnap. He picked up my baby. I was coming home from work. He picked up my baby, he left. He said he was going to Sacramento to see his mom. Two days later he called up. Im in Vegas. Youre never going to see your daughter. Thank you for having this child for me. Like just some crazy stuff. Im thinkingboy, [inaudible 16:05] me. I get a ride to Sacramento for that weekend [inaudible 16:08] we go out there. But it was a workday, so I couldnt go. So Im thinking hes really in Sacramento. He started posting pictures. Started blocking me on social media. And my neighbor saysyou know, your baby is in Vegas. Im likeno, shes not. Then showed me pictures. I [inaudible 16:22] he really took my baby. I:\tHe really did. R:\tMy daughter was eight months. What? My oldest are ten and eleven. So its been a long time. I have not got pregnant, had kids in-between this time. What? And when I had her I truly feltand still feellike god gave me another chance, to do it again. You know? So it was everything. That little girl was everything.  I:\tWhy would he do that? R:\tHe was ready to go. He didnt like the environment.  I:\tWere you here at the time? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. We both stayed together. And her first month he was working. And then so I was on welfare. So welfare switched it. I had to work and he stayed at home. He didnt like that. So as Im getting money in, Im not giving it to him. That was the problem. So he told everybody why he left was because I didnt know how to spend the money right or whatever.  It was never about money. It was about this child. You know what I mean? Like, okay, he has a daughtershes ten years old. You were not allowed in her life. So all that to say this little girl means a lot to you. Which she also means a lot to me, too. You know? And so we made a vow, made a promise when I was pregnant with her that if anything  if were not going to be together were going to go to court together and were going to sit down and do this together. I:\tRight. R:\tBecause of the simple fact that I know what this child means. Well, yeah. It didnt work out that way. So I did [inaudible 17:47]. I went to the courthouse. I did everything, anything. But they cant do nothing because its out of the jurisdiction. So theyre like I have to go to Vegas and file paperwork. Argh. I dont know where hes at in Vegas. He wont tell me. It just  its overwhelming. Yeah. I got a lot going on. I didnt even know I was pregnant. [Break] I:\tThat was like the second question! Were going to be here for a while .Okay. So, I want my family to be involved in my life.  R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tUmm  somewhat agree? I:\tBut you made a funny face. Why did you make that face? R:\t[Laugh] Like  because it just  its different. Before my momma died, you know, everybody was coming to my house. [Inaudible 18:46] my phone [inaudible] and they needed something, but it was just on the strength of I felt like I was important. I felt like I was making a difference in some kind of small way. But  yeah. Now its just my phone dont ring unless its CPS or my [inaudible 19:04] [laugh]. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tThats why. I:\tAnd so it feels like it was a major turning point for you, was when your mom passed. R:\tDefinitely. That was definitely When my mom passed and my daughter got took. Yeah. I:\tWhy would they stop calling after your daughter got taken from you? R:\tThats the thing. I cant even tell you. You know how you can tell when someone is real genuine and you just  or somebody is just for show or whatever? I still have a few cousins every now and then who will reach out to me. And thats genuine. But theyre all the way in Arkansas. And you know, its like that. So the ones who are here  I dont know. It just be complicated. And then when I call them and Ill really need to talk, or just want to come see them or whatevertheres always something. All right. Whatever. You have a good day. I:\tSo from what I hear you saying, it sounds like you feel abandoned. Like, most of your family members have abandoned R:\tMost definitely. I do. Most definitely I do. Just because they know my situation. And theylike when my youngest daughter [name], I had reached out to my family and I told them. And it was just like  to be honest, it was just like a giggle, almost. Well, [inaudible 20:19] got your other kids. It waswhat? Huh?  Im calling yall to ask yall how to do the paperwork for court, or what is the process, you know? And what the procedure is. Have you ever experienced this before? You know what I mean? And its just likegirl, youll get over it. You know? Im not looking for nobody to feel bad for me or nothing. Just need help. I need guidance. Im young. I may be 31, but Im young. I dont know what yall know or what yall have. You know what I mean? Whew. Its a struggle. I:\tThats tough. So the next one ismy family is a source of support for me. I imagine you would respond by saying strongly disagree? R:\t[Laugh] I:\tI fight a lot with my family members.  R:\tI aint got nobody to fight with. I:\tI often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tAint nobody there to disappoint. I:\tAndI am criticized a lot by my family R:\tAll the time. Strongly agree. I:\tOkay. This set of questions is in a similar vein. The first one isI have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.  R:\t[Inaudible 21:36]. I:\tAndI have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.  R:\tYep. I:\tIts your auntie? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIs it the same auntie? R:\tYep. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job. R:\tYes. I:\tIs it the same auntie? R:\tYes. I:\tIm just going to assume its your auntie, unless you tell me otherwise. I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tYes, my auntie. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed. R:\tThat would be two; my auntie, and my little cousin. I:\tAnd thenI have somebody in my family who would provide me with some financial support. R:\tOh, yes. Most definitely my auntie.  I:\tSo, [Name], tell me more about this auntie of yours. Who is she?  You said shes not blood. It sounds like shes R:\tShes my Auntie [Name]. My grandma took her in when she was 14. She ran away from her home. One of her  my cousin is best friends. Thats how we know her; she had been around our family for so long. I didnt re-meet her until my mom passed. Actually, it was like Id say maybe a month and a-half before my moms passing.  She started coming around. Shes real, like, flashy. She got the gold teeth. All the rings. All the fingers. Fur coats. You know? I was likewho is this lady? So when I met her they were like, This is your Auntie [name]. And Im like this aint my auntie. We dont dress like that. You know? Uh-uh [no], honey. We dont get down like that. You know? It was something about her.  And so my mom used to tell me all these stories about their childhood; how they went to school together, and they were just so closenothing or nobody could break up their bond.  And so after my mom passed  my moms two sistersbiological sistershad a [inaudible 23:54] my mom had a service, that we sat at the table. They were going to pay for the service, and bla-bla-bla. All the stuff. In my presence they paid for the service. Well, when they left, after that they came and took the money back. And called [inaudible 24:10] or whatever. So the service for my mom, the lady called me and was telling me that theres no service and  What are you talking about? Were walking out the door in our limo. Our family came from everywhere. And she was likeWell, Miss [Name] and Miss [Name] came and took the money, and the deposit. And they said they dont want nothing to do with it. And Im likewhat? So [inaudible 24:30] this $3600 by myself? And Im just sitting here, like  on the day of my mommas service? For real?  So by the grace of god my auntie and her husband paid for it. Man, theyve done a lot. They dont a lot. Since my momma been gone, even when my daughter was in CPSthey were trying to get my daughter. When my baby dad took my baby to Vegas, they bought me a ticket to go to Vegas. With this baby theyre supportive. So she hasnt left my side at all.  I:\tAnd how long has it been? R:\tIts been three years. And my biological [inaudible 25:08] be likewell, we dont like her. Because you know, she be stingy. Like I say, they got a lot of money. They went from being  to actually literally dope fiendscrackheads. People in the Tenderloin. So her husband is a bus driver. They own a home. They have their own kids. You know, like their houseyou walk into it, its like [seven? 25:27] bedrooms. What? So thy changed their life around for the better. And thats why they cant stand them. My Auntie [Name] is in the projects, you know? Yall be still struggling. And theyre not. Its not like Im their favorite, but they know my situation. So if I was to call and say I need this or I need that, or whatevertheyre coming.  Like I was saying, I was just sayingAuntie, I just need to get away. My living situation is horrible right now. Im going through financial problems, and everything is just not good right now. And so it just to be away. Instead of sayingwell, I dont know what to tell you or  it was good for somebody to say, Ill be there at 6:00 in the morning. You be ready. I:\tRight. You have that. R:\tI do. So she plays a major role. I:\tIm glad. Im glad that you have that. Im glad that you have her. We all need somebody. R:\tRight? I:\tOkay. Family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that are not in our best interest, and be sources of stress. Can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends that provide good examples the good, supportive influences? But also the bad influences on your life.  R:\tWell, the bad influencespeople will tell you real fast  Im a Capricorn, so Im blunt, hard-headed, stubborn. And now I dont do that influence. Im not easy influenced at all. But as far as someone influencing me in a positive way? I most definitely say I could be a follower at times.  Like, if I see everyone  knowing my conditionIm pregnantand knowing I have a [letter? 27:13] I cant go [to work until November? 27:14]. But if my neighbors or my friends about to go to a job fair, Im going too. I need an application, too. You know? Or someone, theyre about to go to the food bank. Oh, Im going, too. I aint got no food or nothing, but  you know? So little things like that. But as far as like a bad influence? Nah. Uh-uh [no]. My mind frame is just way beyond a lot of stuff. Ive been and done a lot of stuff. So I dont get amused easily. I:\tIs it because youre 31, and so you feel like youve matured beyond that? Or has that always been the case for you? R:\tNah, I feel like Im just mature beyond it. Like I said, Ive done itIve been there and done it. So like my upbringing has been a lot different. Its been different. Being raised in San Francisco, you know? From the projects. To going to Oregon. To living with your dad and his white ladyso you do have this big old house, and you  yall going to Disneyland, yall doing stuff yall aint never did at the projects. You know? Its a different atmosphere. But then it slowly switched up, right? As you get older, and you get introduced to a different side of Portland, Oregon. And its Crips and Bloods. And youve got a choice; either/or. You know? So I choose to be a Blood. Me and my older brother is Bloods. And my little brother is a Crip. And  oh, man; talk about the hardest thing in America. Thats  thats  yeah. I:\tTell me how that was the hardest. Tell me about that. I honestly, [Name], have no idea how one would get caught up in that. R:\tIt was difficult. Our father had came out here from California, first of all, and got us. My auntie had us. We was born and raised across the street [inaudible 28:56]. My grandma passed, which was my fathers mom. She passed. My auntie got us, which is my moms sister. My mom and my dad always been on drugs. Always. So my [name], she had got us. She only got me, my older brother, my little sister. My little brother was at my grandmothers house. She stayed on [place].  It was different, living with my auntie. Like, a lot of different. We had things happen to us, you know? Molestation, rapewhatever the case may be. So my dad had left. And he got clean in Oregon. And so in 96 he came back for us. And in 96 I had to testify against my uncle and throw my uncle in jail for life. That changed a lot of family. That changed a lotlike drastically. I still have aunties and cousins who actually lie, and wont talk to me when I come. And when they see me they go off out of the room. Just critical. I have cousins who Ive only seen, but we aint never talk because their parents keep us away. And they be likewell, [inaudible 29:58], you the life of the party. Its just a lot of controversy.  I:\tYeah. So when you were around eleven, twelvehe came and brought you back? R:\tWhen I was twelve my dad had came and got us. And it was in Oregon. We stayed in Portland, Oregonin southeast, which is all the white people. So it was fine. We were cool. It was different for us, but it was cool. We were getting good grades, first and foremost. You know, our mind frame and our education was upping a lot. Then when I turned about like 15 me and my dad had an altercation, and he hit me. When he hit me he hit me like I was a [inaudible 30:37] the street. Me and my little brother, we  were twins, so [inaudible 30:40] each other twins. Were so close. So when he hit me, it was my reactionI threw a cup of water in my daddys face. And my little brother flew over the table. So we were both on him. It was just hectic. That next morning I woke up with bruises and swollen, and everything. And we still had to go to school. So my brother  I never wanted to tell no one. But my brother had went to the counselor and saw the counselorthe guidance counselor. And she called me in there. And its about my face. Its in my presence. She already knew, right?  I:\tShe could tell. R:\tRight? So they had made the call. And by the time we got home after school we see these white people. And first thing, we say liketheyre the [inaudible 31:17] people, like they have in San Francisco. CPS. We know them kind  of people. And my little sister was sitting there, and she was just crying. Im likewhats going on? And so you know, the lady had talked to us. The police came. [Inaudible 31:29] came into this with my dad. It was just horrible. So we all was [inaudible 31:34] in a group home. But then we got split up. They let my little sister stay with me. My brother had to go elsewhere. And thats what made us   So the older we got, my little sister was returned to my father. But I wasnt. My little brother wasnt. About  when I was 17, I ended up meeting this guy. I was in a group home, but I was in a group home with a [pastor? 31:57] lady. And I had a  this how I was easily influenced back then. It was another foster sister. She keeps talking about this party. Were going to sneak out; were going to do this, were going drink, were going to smoke. Well, I dont know anything about that kind of sort. Because my other foster momshe didnt play that. I was [inaudible 32:14] to church. I couldnt even cuss right. I was [inaudible 32:18]. You know, didnt even know how to do nothing right. And smoke? So it wasokay  yeah.  Well, we sneak out and we go to the party. And that changed my life forever. I got drunk. And I had sex with a few men. Smoked weed. Popped ecstasy pills. And it was  oh my god, it was life-changing. It was life-changing because of the simple fact that I felt bad for  It was out of my character. It was just different. And I dont know. Like  I dont know.  I guess the love and all the stuff I was missing as a childI found it within this one house. It was a bigger house; upstairs, downstairs. I think it was all Bloods. And it was just family oriented, and it was just different. They had females, and everybody got along. They laughed. They ate together. They cooked together. They were all together for everything. And I would come over there like every day after school. Sometimes I skipped school just to get here and just sit and watch them. So infatuated by it, you know?  So I ended up meeting a guy. His name is [name]. They call him [name]. Got pregnant by the man. So I thought. After I had had my son I got jumped in. But when I had my son things changed. He was violent. Like  he  he tried to mold me, because I was young. I had my son when I was 18. He tried to mold me, but it wouldnt just work like that. He did drugs. He did [powder? 33:55]. They would be the worst nights. But for eight and a-half years I endured that. And  like, I had to go. I had to go. My son was six months. And enough was enough. I had jumped off the balcony. And I had sprained my ankle. I had my son tucked in my little shirt, to make sure I:\tYou were trying to escape. R:\tLike, it was too many hospital incidents. Too many black eyes. I  on my graduation day he wouldnt let me walk the stage. Likeno. You aint going to no more school. I am your teacher. Im likewhat? All my friends are like[inaudible 34:32] playing, huh? Im likeno, he aint playing. It was just  my dad, didnt [inaudible 34:38] for nothing. But then again, when I calledlike, Daddy, he hit me, or, He gave me this shiner, he aint coming. Oh my god. He dont even give a fuck about his daughter. So it was different. So I ended up getting jumped into the Bloods.  My son, after he was about like four months, me and my friends were in the car. We were joyriding or whatever. And we decided to bang on some girls. They had on blue. We had on red. So we hopped out. Were arguing, were fighting. We beat them up. Then we see this group of men come. They Crips. We likeless call our niggers, you know? And it just so happened Im looking at one of these dudes and he looked so fucking familiar. I havent seen my brother in so long. So Im likethat dude looks familiar. And my friend is like, Were about to cut this nigger. Im likeno, no; dont cut that one. [Laugh] I:\tWow. R:\tSo Im looking. And he look  but hes got facial hair now. Were older, you know  I:\tHe looks like a man. Yeah. R:\tSo the whole time, with so much commotion. But I froze and he froze. And youre supposed to Im likedamn. We leave. And the whole night my head is racing. We never spoke. I never heard his voice or nothing. But it was just awkward. So the next day the dudesthe Blood dudesis talking about what happened, and why we didnt do this and that, or whatever. My baby daddy beat me up. I got punished.  We had went to the mall to go steal. So Im in [Niketown? 36:09 ]. I never get out my Niketown[?] stuff, and all this stuff in my bag. Im getting ready to go out at night, out. And see this same dude. His back was turned, but I knew it was him because of all the damn blue he got on, first of all. But the hair. So Im like [inaudible 36:25] say something. I aint going to say nothing. So I walk in there. Im walking, but I turn backwards. So I accidentally bumped into him. So Im just going to run.  Instantly he [pulled? 36:37] out. I flamed up. He got his color on. He looking at me. And Im like, [says name]. He stepped back. And he was like, [says name]. And we just sort of like hugged each other. Im crying, like fucking  he just hugged me tight.  So when his folks came and my folks came, and they  Oh, my god. It was horrible. We have [inaudible 36:59], you know?  Like  [inaudible 37:01]. I kept saying oh my god. [Inaudible 37:07]. It was a lot of commotion. But then when I went home I explained to my baby dad, like my little brother is a Crip. Not knowing  my little brother is one of them niggers, you know? I dont give a fuck. Whoa. That right there made me feel some kind of way. So all the abuse, everything was just likeIve got to leave.  Because Im going to get my brother called. Because every time I see him now, I know its himIm going to want to talk, hug, something. It aint going to be on no [inaudible 37:37]. So I was likeIm gone. I [inaudible 37:40] my son was a year. By then, my brotherhe grown. Grown now. And things has changed a little bit. So they had a [inaudible 37:51], and he was [inaudible 37:51] the Crips. Those who were getting kicked out [inaudible 37:54], click up and [inaudible] each other. So it was cool. Some Bloods, they [inaudible 37:59] with the Crips and [inaudible 38:01].  I seen him. And we were just talking forever, and ever, and ever. It was just so lovely. So amazing. And I was telling himyou know that first night, I was going to stab you. Boy, I swear to god. And my [inaudible 38:14], she was going to cut you I:\tRight. R:\tHe was likewhat? I said hmm-hmm [yes]. I swear. Your eyes. Youve got momma eyes. I said thats the only way I knew. If not, I would have been likedamn, due to stupidity and you want to follow the gang. You know? So, yeah. Our big brother was never  after we got took, he was always in the streets and whatever. So we arent seen our  you know, we knew who he was and what he looked like. But we didnt see him like that. Wed see him on occasion.  This little park is a Crip park. By me being a blood, I was out of bounds. But this is my brother. And everybody knew Im his sister. So its cool for me to go over there. Shit, whatever. But this car pulled up. And you just see this big old light-skinned dude. My brother is light-skinned, with green eyes. A big old light-skinned dude popping out [inaudible 39:02]. And he flamed up. Im looking at my little brother. You know him? He likehell, no. You know him? [Laugh] Were both likenah. So my brother and I, were getting ready to pull out.  And at the time I was only carrying knives [inaudible 39:17]. So Im likewell, whats up then. So when he gets closer Im just staring. Like, oh my god. [Brother]? He likeI heard yall little niggers was over here. And we didnt [inaudible 39:31]. Its crazy. I dont know how to explain it, but its like the stupidity of the gang brought us back together. If not, I think I would have lost my brother and sister. Lost my brothers [inaudible 39:42]. I wouldnt have found them but seen [inaudible 39:44]. You know? So that was different. And by people knowing that we were all siblings, a lot changed for us. I could go anywhere the Crips go and they can go anywhere the Blood are at. So it was cool. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd then [inaudible 39:57] our older cousinsone to Blood, one to Crip. But them, their relationship was horrible. They [inaudible 40:02] shoot, always try to kill each other. They [inaudible 40:05]. But for us, it was nice. My [dad?] didnt like it. He didnt like [inaudible 40:10]. But it was nice. To this day, my little brotheryou know how I hear people talking and they say blood, as just in general? Instead of saying nigger they say blood. Nah. My little brother came out here and was ready to fight with everybody, anybody. Theyre like, So how you doing, young blood? What? What you mean? No, no, no; hes not banging on you. Thats just how they talk. I:\tRight. R:\tHe cant do California. So he went back to Oregon. Like, literally he thought everybody was being funny, or everybody was going to bang on him. But not knowing that its just a figure of speech. Instead of people saying, niggers and bitches, young blood, or, whats up blood? Youi know? It was different. I:\tHow old is he now? R:\tNow hes  Im 31. [Brother] is maybe 28. I:\tOkay. So you mentioned earlier that you have four children. And in some ways youve described your relationship with your oldest son to me. And your daughter has been moved to Philly? Is it your daughter? And how old is she now? R:\tShes 11. She made 11 in March. Thats my right hand. I:\tAnd your one year-old is in Las Vegas, you think, now.  R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo it sounds like you dont have much of a relationship with your daughter in Philly? Do you? Do they allow you to have R:\tLike, me and herwere super-close. [Daughter], thats all I know. After my son being  like the way he was. Umm  I was young. I had [son] and [daughter] back-to-back.  I:\tDo they have the same father?  R:\t[Daughter]s dad is in California. I went to Oregon to have her. My baby daddymy sons fatherhe was a stand-up man, and he took care of my daughter. But like I said, I was young and there was a lot I was doing. So I had a verbal agreement that I would go to [Interruption] I:\tSo you were saying. R:\tBut [name], the dadmy sons dadtook care of her. We had a verbal agreement that I go to California for three months, because I needed time off. There was a lot going on, like I said. So when I came back to get my kids it was a different story. Umm  my   my baby dad and his mom beat me up. They jumped me. I called the police. By the time the police came I was swinging; I was hitting my baby dad in the face. That makes it violence. At [inaudible 42:52]. I was the party that got arrested, even though I was showing them the bruises and the scrapes. And it didnt matter. They seen me physically hitting him when I pulled up. So, okay.  I go to jail for like a week. I get out. Had a police escort take me to get my kids. Well, I got one backwhich was [daughter]. But the other onemy sonI didnt get back. Because his name was on the birth certificate. So that was  it was a difficult challenge. By me being in jailwithin that little week he had went to court, got temporary custody. Turned out that his girlfriend had signed my name. Forged my name. So [inaudible 43:31] me of my rights and all this stuff. I:\tAnd you couldnt prove that she had done that. R:\tRight. Right. So I dont write cursive. When I do, I cant write it like that. So I only do my name, you know? And I write my name a certain way, so. I was trying to tell peoplethat aint my name. I aint wrote that. Ill show you now right now. You know? Man. So, yeah. I got [daughter] back, and  I:\tAnd the only reason why you got her back is because hes not on her birth certificate, so he cant prove that thats his child. R:\tBasically. So I stayed  that was the worst time in my life. I couldnt tend to my daughter. I couldnt feed her. I couldnt change her. I couldnt do nothing. My dad had to come get her. And I would just  stayed in my bed, and cried and cried and cried. And then after a while I told my dad Im leaving. If I cant have my son, I cant be around my sonthere is no need for me to be in Portland, Oregon. Period. And I been gone ever since. And my son was four.  My baby daddy be doing some [threatful? 44:32] stuff. And so I dont play with it. Because hes very violent. Very, very violent. And he does what he says. So I dont test him. I dont play with him. I dont  I [inaudible 44:43] to have my son all the time. Im going to have to just be one of them parents that Ill wait until you turn 18. I:\tAnd then you can have a relationship with him. R:\tAnd were going to have to talk about it. Because there are certain things you dont know. Like the man you living with. I want to tell me son [inaudible 44:51] the man he living with is not his dad. I said I was young. When I went to the house the first time, bought a buzzI had sex with multiple men. Well, one of them I had sex with is his daddy. He look identical like him, which is his best friend  its complicated. But now that were older it just going to weigh out the other. He wont give me a blood test. He wont do nothing. Its just whatever. So my son, Ill wait until he turns 18.  And [daughter], shes all I know. Thats my best friend. Thats everything. Like, the struggle has always been real with me and my baby. We was homeless for five years. [Inaudible 45:29], bus stops, like outside. Anything you can think of. Cars. Just everything. We had got a  it was in Sacramento, living with my cousin. Sleeping on her floor. It was like a house with twelve people. Two bedrooms. Row hood. We just  it was three families in one home. So it was a lot.  But me and my cousin got into it that morning. She was like, Well, you and your daughter can get out. And she was throwing my stuff outside. And Im being funny, like we [inaudible 46:02] my name on the house unless my name been on the house. Ill call [inaudible 46:04] right now. And they had said to come get my keys. Girl, I could leave your house. Talking stuff and whatever. And shes likewell, call them. You think I wont? So when I call theyre like, Oh, weve been looking for you. We have for you [inaudible 46:17]. Swear to god. And I was just screaming. I really tore up, talking stuff to my cousin. [Inaudible 46:21]. This was all [inaudible].  So I came to Californiacame to San Francisco. And me and my daughter got this unit. We took it as is. There was no windows, no doors. It was this horrible [inaudible 46:35] and we took it as is. For us to have nothingto have our own? I:\tYeah. R:\tOh my god. Like, that was everything. It was everything. I had [moved? 46:46] my mom in. She was fine. She was cool. But then like, after a month of her staying she kept saying she was sick. I was likeyou sick? You aint sick, girl. Stop playing. She play a lot. So Im likeyou aint sick. Shes likeno, Im really sick. Yeah, okay, you sick then. Im Hilary Clinton. I used to mess with her.  So her and my daughter, they got a super relationship. Oh my god, like you would think thats her momma. But they  her and my daughter was talking one day and my daughter came in and, Momma, you know my grandma got cancer? I was likeshe got what? Yeah, she been spitting up blood everywhere. And so when I went in there I was just so  more so mad that  you told me you was sick. But you didnt tell me you had cancer. You know? You were telling this little child, you know? And then [daughter] is thinking its just like a cold or  You know, shes even throwing up blood. You know what I mean? So it was different. But the processme and [daughter], it was horrible for a little girl to go through that. But she helped my mom; with the diapers, the blood, anything you can think of. My daughter is right there, you know? But it was getting too overwhelming for both of us. So I moved my cousins from Sacramento out here. I:\tThe same ones you were staying with and arguing with? Okay. R:\tYeah.  I:\tYou needed help. You needed support. R:\tI needed help. Thats my moms favorite niece. And she used to be a little nurse, so she knew more about it. Their room was [daughter]s room. This is my room back here. My room is my mom. And I was in the living room. Gave [daughter]s room to my cousins. And me and [daughter] was in here. So that was the biggest mistake, ever. Me not knowing my child [inaudible 48:25]. She was doing so well in school prior to them coming. When they came everything changed. She started fighting. [Inaudible 48:30], going through the motions. You know, when you got other stuff going on youre not really paying attention. As long as youre going to schooland I know shes going to school; she comes home, shes got homework. Not really in-depth with her, like how was your day really? Not what youre telling me, but youre going to check this  more hands-on, basically. I wasnt. It was just a lot. It was a lot, a lot.  So my mom, she had come home with hospice. But hospice had said that they wanted to move her to [place] because they didnt want me and my daughter to wake up to her dead, basically. Because it was getting close to that time. She only had certain weeks left. And you could tell. So, okayI denied it. No, she is going to stay here. Me and my mom got into a heated argument. She started talking about my son and saying hurtful stuff. Im saying hurtful stuff. So I kicked her out. I:\tYou kicked your mom out. R:\tI kicked my mom out. The biggest thing I regret, ever. I blame her definitely, but I kicked her out. I called my uncle. Come get your sister right now. Shes so fucking disrespectful. Shes so rude. [Inaudible 49:37]. December  [inaudible] January. When I say  [inaudible 49:38] alike; the way we talked, danced[?]. Everything and anything is identical. People with us on my family dont like me, because theyre likeyoure just like your momma. Identical. Everything. I dont be knowing it; it just be, I guess, just natural.  I:\tSo what was going on with you during that period of time that you would kick her out at that point? Tell me what you were feeling R:\t[Sigh] It was a lot. Like, it was on the fact of that my houseyou cant smoke in here, you cant drink in here, you cant do nothing. My momma was already on machines. But my cousin who came and moved inshe came and moved in with her, her baby daddy, her oldest daughter, her youngest daughter, her other son, her other son. And one of her daughters boyfriends. So thats seven heads already. On top of me, my momma and [daughter]. Thats ten of us. The [inaudible 50:27] is there. My momma hear everybody else is in here. It was just  it was crazy. A lot of attitudes, a lot of tension.  But she took it upon herself to start smoking cigarettes in my house. She would smoke in the room. And Im like what the fuck is that smell? You know what I mean? You cant respectgo out somewhere, go on the balcony? It was just  it was to the point that it was just turning my house to their old house. Their house in Sacramento was nasty. They had roaches. It was a lot of stuff, you know what I mean? So it was different for me and [daughter]. Like, Girl? Uh-uh [no]. And we talked like that, like thats my friend. She be like, Girl, you got to tell your cousin they got to go. And I be likeright?  But my momma insisted that [cousin] stay. Like I said, that was her favorite niece. And she wanted her. And thats another part of me moving her out herebecause my momma requested it, wanted her. But when she got here  She was hands-on with my mom. But as far as anything else, she wasnt respecting the house. If you see somethingyour kids do something, clean it up. It was just horrible. Constant attitudes. Her baby daddy would wake up arguing, yelling. Dont want to clean up. Dont want to get no job. Dont want to do nothing. [Inaudible 51:35] in here. Something gotta give. Me and [daughter] [inaudible 51:39] aint going to feed everybody. Argh. It was crazy.  But that night we were arguing, [name] kept telling mejust be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Man, forget that lady. Forget that lady. My uncle never came. I went the hospital. My grandmother was in the hospitalwhich is my moms mom. Shes at General. Come on, [daughter], were leaving. We go to her hospital. Im talking to my grandma. We called her Big Momma. Im like, Big Momma, man; your daughter is too much. Man.  It got to the point where now my momma wanted to drink. She wanted a cigarette. Its my last days, I might as well. [Name], are you [inaudible 52:18]. As far as you comingno, she was doing good. She wasnt even thinking about it. You know?  So I was getting frustrated. I was talking to my grandma, like  she wasnt responding. She was on the tubes and stuff. But I just kept talking to herlike what do I do? Youve got to give me a sign. Because this is your daughter. How did you deal with her for all these years? And like  it was crazy. I was there for like 30 minutes. My daughter was ready to go because there were no more cartoons on TV. Im likeall right. I took my pictures. We walked from General to here. By the time we got in the house, to my mommas room, took off my coatthe phone ring. My grandma had left. She passed.  I:\tWow. R:\tSo I was like  dang, thats crazy. We didnt want to tell my momma. So my momma never knew that her momma was gone. The whole timeher little last weeks and months she never knew that her momma was gone. I:\tHow did she pass? R:\tMy grandma had complications from her breathing machine. She had a tank that she [inaudible 53:10]. And when she needed it the nozzle had failed. It was jammed, or it was something. But it didnt work. And it was a brand-new tank that just got delivered that day. So her oxygen. But it was horrible. I:\tHow old was she? R:\tI couldnt even tell you. We didnt have a good relationship. Im named after her, and all this stuff. But I wasnt too fond of that lady. My uncle molested meher son. I went to her and told her. She told me its a family secret. She was like, Girl, its a family secret. You better not tell nobody. You aint the first one. What? So ever since then Ive never been too fond of her. But when she was sick and stuff, you knowI started to feel kind of bad. Like, dangyou always talked bad about this lady. You know? But I got a kind of relationship with her before she passed. So, whatever. But I dont know.  But after a few  a few weeks after my grandma passing [inaudible 54:09] the argument, my mom [inaudible 54:12]. It was just overwhelming. My other cousin had moved in. Him and his girlfriend. Without me even knowing. [Name] took it upon herself. Yeah, cousin; [inaudible 54:22].  So I come home one day and see these extra two bodies. And weed, smoking  you see my mom on the balcony with her damn nightgown on, pissy as hell, with a cigarette and a bottle of [inaudible] Vodka. And I am just like  what happened? This aint the right house. Go [inaudible 54:38] are you serious? And my little cousins, theyre all looking at me because I know how I am. Theyre likeoh my god. You know? Were about to get kicked out. You know? All right, you guys. Whatever.  So I see [inaudible 54:53] and I was telling her about it. We were talking about it. And she was like its your moms last few weeks, [name]. Just let her go how she wants to go. She was likeyou did what you did. You helped her how you could help her. So it was  I was angry because she was doing good. She didnt need the alcohol. She didnt need the cigarettes. You know what I mean?  So my auntie had come up [inaudible] these big-ass bottle of vodka. I mean, the biggest bottles ever. And hella cigarettes. But she made her feel good about herself. She put her lipstick on, and I brushed my mommas hair. My momma never left the house. The doctorseverything and everybody came to her. You know what I mean?  So my auntie was like, We should go to my house. No, shes not. And I was likewhat do you mean? Well, she ended up in Antioch.[Inaudible 55:38]. She started going out to dinners, and  you know, she was feeling herself again. But then she started getting hecka sick and whatever.  We got in an argument. I kicked her out. My uncle had came. I threw all her stuff in the hallway; her wheelchair. I was just emotional. Like the stuff she was saying.  You and your fucking dying bad ass, you arent going to talk to me? Are you serious? You get the fuck out. It was just so overheated. It was uncalled for. It was just  it was uncalled for. So I put her out and my uncle came and got her.  Well, he took her to his other brothertheir other brothers house. And he got a studio. My momma cant be on the floor. Shes sick. Shes dying. She had a bed. They put her on the floor. She was on the floor for three days. Im thinking my uncle [inaudible 56:28]. Im thinking my momma is at my auntie and my uncles house this whole time. For three days. Im calling. What [mother] doing? Oh, shes eating. Let me talk to her. Oh, uh-uh [no], she dont want to talk to you. Whatever. But Im calling and calling. By the third day bring my momma home. Hes likeI aint got her. What do you mean, you aint got her? She with [other uncle]. Bring my momma home. Hes like I aint got her. Well, where is [mother] at? The people came and got her. They reported me. One of my aunties had reported me to the people. Oh, god. So they came. I:\tFor what? Neglect of an elderly person? R:\tSo they came and  took her to Laguna Honda. That was the worst thing ever. That was the worst thing. My momma kept saying she didnt want to die at Laguna Honda. She didnt want to go to Laguna Honda; Laguna Honda kills people and they die fast. She knew what she was talking about. She was in her right state of mind. She had a stroke, so this part cant workbut as far as her mental, she knew what she was talking about. So thats why I kept to her, thats why I kept dealing with so much. Because I knew she didnt want to leave. But it was also taking a toll on me. It was horrible. But she ended up going to Laguna Honda. Three days later CPS came. Snatched my baby.  I:\tSo they took your daughter because R:\tThey took my daughter because my daughter went to school and she was acting out. She was so frustrated, so frustrated, so frustrated. And she went up there and told so many lies and allegations. It was just crazy. When they came down here to interview me and talk to me they came at nighttime. Im laughing at the man, like what are you here for? What are you talking about? What happened? And he had talked to her, and I had been in the other room while he talked to [daughter] by herself. He asked [daughter] does she feel safe. [Daughter] was like uh-uh [no]; its too many people. I want to go with you. You know, what kids say [inaudible 58:28].  [Big sigh] So [daughter] went with them. After a while she just started saying allegations. I had 32 charges. Said I tied her to the balcony. I beat her. I had her in the bathtub and I choked her, I [inaudible 58:44.]. My cousins took advantage of her. It was all so much. But then after the first year, when she realized that she wasnt coming home  she had thought, Okay, Im going to play this [inaudible 58:53] and Im coming home. After the first year it came out that she was just so mad and so overwhelmed that  we was homeless, and the people we lived with treated us bad. We had her own place. She had her own room. But then I moved the people who treated us bad in. I:\tShe was really angry with you. R:\tAnd I gave them her room. So she was homeless all over again. She didnt have nothing. And my mom was here, and all the attention was going on my momma and not [daughter]. There were so many people that [daughter] just felt like she was just [inaudible 59:21], you know? So at the time I didnt understand it. But now I understand it. Yeah.  But even when she was took we still I went to visit her every place she went to. Stayed in contact on the phone. Always remained in contact. Like, the relationship always been strong. And it got to the point where the people would call and be like, Can you talk to her? Can you come up here? No, no; yall came and took her from my home. Yall work with her. It got to the point where, We cant do it. Well, return her home. It was just crazy.  So 52 weeks of parenting class. Counseling. So much. This and that. And pretrial diversion and everything. And I was doing it. Pretrial diversion used to call me and let me know how far along I was doing, and what I had to do and whatever [inaudible 60:12]. They stopped calling. So when they stopped calling Im likeoh, Im done. Hell, yeah. I stopped. I:\tBut you werent done? R:\tRight. So we had recertification, and went to court. The course I only did 36 fucking weeks of parenting class. I:\tHow many weeks were you supposed to do? R:\t52. I had only did a certain amount of x, y, and z of counseling. Because [inaudible 60:39] they didnt request me to go to counseling no more. Its drug testing, and I had completed it. I had stopped going. The judge said I didnt have to do it no more. So Im thinking Im done. Well, no one ever contacted me to tell me no. So recertification, I didnt  I had got denied for her to come back home, and [inaudible 61:01] placement. And thats when my [inaudible 61:04]. But they was likeno. So I was likewell, I got a few people in mind. They looked into them and they said no. I dont want her to go into the system. So I [inaudible 61:17], at the time we were fine. But then he was likeokay, yeah. Well, I dont know what happened between. I dont know what happened.  He ended up just  going against me. He had gone on my facebook page and looked at old pictures where I used to smoke weed, and my tattoo on my back, and  he presented it in court like this is  shes a gang-banger and this and that. And she aint got her older son. And she used to be in Portland, like this. Damn. Whoa. Are you serious? So by me selecting him, it backfired. I havent spoke to this man in like three years.  [Daughter] still keeps in contact with him. Like, before she moved to Philly I didnt even know that he was calling her to see her. And our visits have always been supervised. Phone conversations always been supervised. When he comes, everything is unsupervised. Im not knowing this until [daughter] tells me. Im likewhat do you mean? Shes likeme and my goddad have stayed in a hotel [inaudible 62:14] about three days. Huh? And when I bring it up to the social worker it would never go nowhere. So I really made sure that me and [daughter] remain close, like  Because I know eventually she was going to leave. They said she was going to Oregon.  I:\tBut then they sent her to Philly. R:\tBut then about Aprilbecause her birthday was in March, and she was in Santa Rosa and the state [inaudible 62:41] issues a transportation check every month when you go see [daughter]. They wasnt doing it. And I was depending about it because [inaudible 62:48] never went nowhere. So for her birthday in MarchI never miss a birthday, ever. I dont care where shes at, Im coming. Well, for the birthday they told her that her mother  like your momma is sick and shes not able to come. But in April we have a surprise birthday party for you and your mom will be here. I didnt know nothing about it. So when I did talk to [daughter] in April she was like, Are you still coming for my party? Im likewhat party? Shes like, My birthday party. What are you talking about? So shes telling me. And Im like I dont know nothing about it. I said I dont have no way out there. That phone conversation was just it.  She called the social worker and the social worker was saying some other stuff. Were going to  No. She said were going to wait for you to leave to do the party. That just made her even worse. So she burned down the place. My baby has never been on medication. Never been hospitalized. Never  never, nothing. When she was in my custody? Nothing. The most that [daughter] do was get suspended from school, at the most. So shes been in CPS, shes been hospitalized over five times. She [inaudible 63:54] on medication. Shes on medication. Shes done been to jail. Shes done been molested. Its been so much. So much. You would not wish on your worst enemy that this little girl has had to endure. You know? So she burned down the place. She was in jail. I was not aware that my daughter was in jail. She was in jail for two and a-half months.  But I kept getting these calls from [inaudible 64:20]. Who the hell is calling me from [inaudible 64:22]? I aint got no boyfriends. Who is this? But she had never said her name. So I would hang up. After a while she said her name one time. Im like  shes likemom  Shes like, Mom, this is [daughter], I love you. [Whispers] I said what the fuck? Hell, no. That was my baby. I called the group home. Can I talk to [daughter]? Oh, no. We gave her a 30-day notice. She is no longer here. 30-day notice? This is a group home. What are you talking about. Stop playing. Theyre like, Miss [name], you have to contact the social worker.  I was reaching out to the social worker. She was never calling, she was never calling. Then [inaudible 64:59] kept calling, and she kept saying her own name. Mom, this is [daughter]. I started bawling. My baby is in jail? What? What happened? Oh. Finally contacted the social worker. She told me the situation. I begged for them to bring her to San Francisco. Shes way up there in Sutter, or Stockton, or Tracy. Whatever. Bring my baby to San Francisco. I can see her out here. I could make it always to [inaudible 65:27]. Just bring her out here. Im [inaudible 65:29] for a minute. Like for about a month. And then she finally came.  [Daughter] was out here for about a week, about a week and a-half. And I seen her, though. And they gave me visits. I was able to go to the jail, to the juvie place to see her and talk to her. Do her hair. We made a plan. Then, out of nowhere, they were likeweve got three choices; Texas, Florida or Philly. What are you talking about? Choices for what? Slow down.  So mind you, the adultsthe social workersnever talked to me. Its always been [daughter]. They tell her and shed tell me. So Im looking at her. Girl, what are you talking about? [Inaudible 66:03] Oregon? No, my baby knew she what she was talking about. She knew what she was talking about. The social worker eventually was telling me that they got a placement and they want her to go to Oregon for two months. Then they want her to go to Philly for two months. And then go to Oregon. While shes in Philadelphia I am not to have any contact with her. I:\tWhy not? R:\tThey want her to start fresh. Start over. I dont know [inaudible 66:28]. Because Im dying. Its every day Im freaking dying, like  this is the longest I have not talked to my daughter. My daughter [inaudible 66:37] two and a-half weeks now. It has been just so horrible. I call up to check on her, but they cant tell me nothing. You have to call the social worker. Ive been calling her up like left and right. I go to her job site. Shes not there. Oh, its killing me. And I know my baby  like, wheres my mom? I need to talk to my mom. I know [daughter]. And if [daughter] not talking to me or seeing me, shell be suicidal. She will try and kill herself. Either slide[?] her wrists, or shell break some glass and shell just swallow glass. Run in front of a car. Shell do something to where they have to reach out to me. Because I still have my parental rights. So you know  but this is the worst thing ever. Yeah. Like I said, [daughter], out of all my kidsthats who I know, what I know. And I had her the longest, and we done been through a lot of [inaudible 67:30].  I:\tYes. R:\tBut her leaving, its difficult. We were in court. The judge had deniedno skype, no phone. They would not pay for me a ticket to go see her. Shes not allowed to reach out to me. And they said if  they said they might possibly think of letter exchange. So last week I called the social worker, like, [Name], can I write [daughter] a letter? Because I have a letter they sent me in the mail that they want me to sign off for her medication and for them to do the physical. In order for them to do anything I have to sign off. So I still didnt sign it yet, because you knowI dont want to.  So [Name] likewell, [daughter] sent you a letter. Well, can I have the letter? She was likeyeah, Ill bring it to you some week[?], next time. Well, its been a whole week. I still havent had it. So tomorrow is Friday. So its going to be two weeks. And I feel like where is the letter? You know what I mean?  You do [inaudible 68:29] all the time. Like, thats stupid. Like  oh my gosh. Youre really going to make my daughter feel like well, my momma dont care.  I:\tYeah. R:\tYou know what I mean? Thats bananas. If you have a letter, you could have left it at the [inaudible 68:39] at the city office and I could have went down and got it. Or once its in the office I could have went and got it. You know what I mean? Like, why are you holding onto this letter? Did you read the letter? Just  I dont know. My frustration with that is at an all-time high.  I:\tAnd you havent gotten the letter. You cant read what your daughter is writing to you. R:\tBecause all of the letters have to go to the workers, and they have to go through it. And then they give it to me. I dont know why. But, okay. Its frustrating. But to be honest, I try not to really think about it.  I:\tSo how do you cope? Because this is a lot. This is a lot. R:\tWhew. I:\tAnd youre pregnant. R:\tI sleep. I sleep a lot. I:\tSo youre depressed. R:\tYou could say that. Honestly, you can say that. I sleep a lot. I do a lot of walking. At the top of the hill is a clinic. I go up there for support groupswomens groups, pregnancy groups and stuff. And I have a doctor, so I can just come in and talk to them any time, any day. Umm. But I try to be  I guess [inaudible 69:42]. Because they know me, and they know me  they know me as the work Im in and out. Go to school. In and out, you know? But now its different. So I guess if I see somebody leavingyou want to go  hell, yeah; I want to go. So they be like youd get in anybodys car, youd go with anybody. Youre just anybodys friend. You [inaudible 70:00]. Whatever. I guess. But if I sit here Im going to cry all day.  Like, I just took down all my pictures. And my mommas little ashes and her set up was right  you know, its a lot when you sit in here. And Im looking at [name] room, likedang. It just  its a lot. [Daughter]s room had been set up for three years. I had all her awards, all her pictures. I havent touched it for three years. I finally took it down the other day, and that broke me. I still got stuff to take off the wall. But just the  it broke me. Like, man. Like I keep saying shes going to come home; leave the room as it is. You know? But  I:\tBut now that youve taken it down it makes you feel like shes not coming home. R:\tI dont like being in my house unless Im going to sleep. So Ill be outside a lot, just  even if Im just sitting there, just looking at the sun and [inaudible 70:47] looking stupid. A lot of people dont know. And some people do know. But I cant  its just difficult. And then having this baby by myself? Last year I had a spouse and everything was going good. You know? Its a lot.  I have medical problems. Ive got to do a blood transfusion and a [inaudible 71:08] transfusion. When I had my daughter I almost  well, I died and they brought me back. But I lost a lot of blood. And I was unconscious. They brought me back. With this pregnancy theyre nervous. Im high risk. They dont want the same thing to happen. They dont want me to go to delivery, and I make it and he dont or he make it and I dont. You know what I mean?  So they want me to have the transfusions, but Im nervous and scared. Because Im by myself, and I dont know nothing about it. And the first thing you hear is transfusion? Oh, shit; Im dying. What do you mean? Its just a lot. But then yesterday the doctor called. My [inaudible 71:36] came. She didnt make it no better. I understand its peoples job, that you have to be straightforward. But, damn. She was like, Well, if you dont have the iron transfusion its going to affect your babys growth, and this and that. Im likereally? So. I dont know. I dont know.  Just going through this pregnancy by myself, its a lot. I mean, I have friends who are supportive in a certain way. But just me. Like last year, that whole room was full of baby stuff for my daughter. It was full of baby stuff. Im six months, and I dont have nothing for my son. I dont even have a damn diaper. I dont have a car seat to bring him. I dont have nothing. So [inaudible 72:19] like oh my god, who [inaudible 72:22]? I mean, I know Ive got my auntie. But damn, thats  like, thats a lot.  So Ive been going to the food banks and all the times I dont have rides. So I cant carry this big-ass box of food up the hill. So Ill be likeforget it, I dont want it. Well, I dont have no food. I dont have no income. I dont have no nothing. Just this month welfare has cut me off. They said when my daughter got took, and I told them about itbecause I didnt want to go to jail for fraud. For receiving aid. So I told them about it, and they said theyd give me until August first for [younger daughter] to return home. If shes not in the home theyre going to cut me off aid. I said okay.  Well, this month my baby daddy called, to let me know hes still in Vegas. [Younger daughter] still in Vegas, or whatever. So I [inaudible 73:06] get nothing this month. I got a letter saying Ill get transitional food stamps for five months. But then on the first I have to go apply for a general assistancea GA. I:\tRight. R:\tIm pregnant. Like, thats not going to work. Tried for [inaudible 73:21], got denied. Disability, got denied. So Im just a sitting duck, you know? Well, damn. What do I do? Where do I go? Who do I call? I dont know. I packed up my house. My baby daddy in Vegas likeyou can come see us, you can come stay with us. You know? Hes juicing it up.  I:\tThe one in Vegas? Yeah. R:\tSo I pack up the house. I [inaudible 73:41]Im ready to go. So [inaudible 73:42 my ticket? You come out here, youre going to be at the bus stop. You aint going to ever see your daughter. What do I look like, bringing you out here? You so  What? Wait. Slow down. Say it again. So it was the backfire in my face. So Im sitting here, likewell, damn. What am I going to do? Because I owe back rent. And Im just thinking  I dont know. Its a lot.  I:\tWith regard to the housing situation, I thought that they made it based on what your income was. R:\tYeah. Thats why its $25 now. Because I dont have nothing. But I still owe back rent. And I  you know, I got a [inaudible 74:24] notice the other day. But aint nothing I can do about it. I:\tRight. R:\tA lot of people be like if you lose your project, then you are stupid. You know you [inaudible 74:33]. You know you dont care about your project. It aint about caring. Its about what Im going to come up with, you know? Like, I dont have the back pay money. Like, $25 [inaudible 74:42]. So Im not worried about that. Its just  you never know when youll go home and you might find an eviction notice on your door. Or might find a board on your door. You know? I:\tSo how much is the back rent? R:\tWhew. A lot. Two thousand. I stopped paying when my momma died. My momma died and started doing a lot of stuff. I was going to school. I was working. I was working at [inaudible 75:10], working at [inaudible 75:11]. I just stopped. Had some  Ill start working again. And I was paying. And then when [name] left I just gave up. I gave up on everything. I cant  I didnt have the motivation. I didnt have life. Since [daughter] been gone its just beenoh, I dont give a fuck. Fuck everything. Fuck anything. Just, whatever. It just  I dont have nothing to look forward to. I mean, I have my baby in my stomach. But I dont I:\tAre you scared? R:\tIm very scared. Im scared. Im nervous. I dont  the abortion was not an option for me. So thats why hes in my stomach. That whole  I laid on my back, I fucked, Im going to get an abortion? No, no. Nah. If I was able to have sex then he is going to be able to be pushed out or cut out, or whatever. But  I dont know. I dont know. Like, my auntie likewell, you can [inaudible 76:09]. Its not about me giving up my baby to you. Its not about that. Its just about this is Its like every year its something different. And its drastic every year. Or something. I guess I just got to recoup and regroup. And  I dont know. I:\tSo its a lot. Its a lot. R:\tLord, its a lot. I:\tSo if you had to do somethingif you could do something just today, what would you do? R:\tIf I had to do something just today Id find somebody to help me with my back rent. Thats my main priority. Im about to have a baby. I cant bring a baby home [inaudible 76:53] a fucking hospital board on a door or  like, I might not even have it by the time he comes, you know? I dont want to be homeless. I dont  its a lot. So every day I be likeoh my god. I found one place, and the process was going good. And then all of a sudden, Oh, we cant help you. Huh? I put all my eggs in this one basket, and youre like, no. So. Argh. Yeah. I:\tHow does one deal with back rent issues? Do you know? Have you gone to speak to them about your situation? R:\tOh, man. Its the lady at the YMCA, she gave me the free resources. But I dont meet the requirements. You have to have at least one child in the home.  I:\tAnd so theyre going to evict you before you have a child? R:\tHopefully, by the grace of god, notI hope not. I really, really pray. I hope not. But Ive been given 14 day notices like clockwork. So. I dont know what to do, but just give it to god. I honestly dont know what to do but to give it to god. Because at this point its just too much for me to handle by myself. And my auntie dont know about my back rent, but if she do she would be freaking mad. Shed pay it, but thats not the point. She will go off. So Ive been trying to keep that If she asks about the rent, Oh, its fine. Its cool. You know? But in reality its likefuck. Only if you knew.  Thats like as far as my food situation, she knows Im pregnant and shell callwhat did you eat today? Im likeI had a sandwich, or I had this snack.

      "\t I:\tWere recording now. Okay. So have you everIm going to get back to these questionshave you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of an emotional or a health condition? R:\tYes. I:\tSo now that its recording Im sure that youre not going to tell me any stories. But well see. Okay. In terms of your emotional health, could you tell me about the times that you've received counseling? R:\tI was in Oregon. Before I went to Oregon I remember a little bitjust very vaguelyme going to counseling out here. I tore up the ladys office. I didnt feel like talking to no white person who was [inaudible 0:48] nothing. I didnt feel I needed to. So I tried to attack her in her office.  And in Oregon, it was a different set up. I was comfortable. She didnt come off as like a therapist. She came off more as a  a person who was concerned and wanted just to hear me. Just wanted to talk to me. And so I began to open up to her. And I liked her.  I:\tHow long did you see her? R:\tFor about like three years. I:\tThats a pretty decent amount of time. R:\tEven when I had got took from my dad, I was still going on my own to go see her. So she was helpful.  I:\tI might have one or two more questions about her. Okay. So do you remember how you were telling me yesterday about the altercation you had with your father? Ive been thinking about that, and what happened after the altercationwhere you got separated from him and stuff. But then I was trying to make sense of it. So I want you to help me. This was a man who, it sounds like, once he found out things werent working out when you were with your momhe came and got you and your brother. Is that right? R:\tFrom my aunties house. I:\tOh, from your auntie. Thats right; from your aunties house. And brought you to Oregon with him. So to me, that indicates that he loves you. Right? And there is a way in which he wanted to R:\tBut he was never there, though. He left us with his wife. So I dont know if he was trying to do this to better your kids life or  or do it to show others that you, you know, that you can do this. But as far as that consistent, steady father rolelike, we can go to our daddy ask for homework or, you know? We didnt have that. My daddy, he was a rolling stone. He came in when he wanted to. Came in days later, when he wanted to. And we always had to deal with his girlfriendhis wife, and his stepdaughter. So its not like he made an impact on our life, to be honest. I:\tSo he picked you up, moved you to Oregon, dropped you in this house. But then you didnt really have much of a relationship with him, once you were there. R:\tRight. Like certain occasionsfamily occasionsyou would swear he was just the best dad. We looked at him likeyeah, okay. After this party hes leaving. Uh-uh [no]. I:\tSo this was just another situation where somebody acted like they  when it was in the public eye, they acted like they were there for you. But as soon as the public went away they werent there for you anymore. R:\tRight. I:\tSo this therapistthis space with this womanended up feeling like a safe space for you. R:\tIt really did. There would be days I wouldnt want to go home. I just wanted to go straight to her office and just stay there. Because I knew what I was going home to. To his wife. Like, coming from the projectsyou feel me  I dont know. We didnt have much. So you had chores. You had to clean up. But we didnt have to do it all  I dont know; just straighten up your room and you can go outside. You know what I mean? [Inaudible 4:09] and you can go outside.  But when we went to Oregon she had us doing hecka different stuff. When we first  we black people, we dont get chores. Aint no cleaning the window. And she had her little animals. The geese. Go clean the geese cage. You know what I mean? Like, what? Who you talking to? Nah, we dont do all that. It was different. My daddy wasnt there to be like  to intervene, or for us to have a second opinion. She wanted us to do this. And we  nah, that aint how you do. Nah. I swear to god, we had geese, we had a cow, and we had goats. We had all kind of stuff.  And first things first, we came from the [inaudible 4:51]. What the hell are those? We see that shit in books. And you know, on TV. What the hell are those? And Ill never forget it; she was trying to introduce us to the geese. And they got names. And they quacking and shit, and theyre running. Like  [laugh] you cant bring in no niggers from the hood to no shit like that. You just cant. Youve got to  pre-warn us or something. I dont know. But that was just  my little sister was scared as hell. And I would just Me and my brothers faces turned up like  the first [inaudible 5:21] we jump [inaudible]. I dont know. But that was just some other shit. I:\tYeah. R:\tNah. I:\tAnd he wasnt there to mediate at all. R:\tNo. And when he was there she would always be like, Well, Robert  She always makes it like I was a ringleader. Because I kind of was. But  [Name] refused to go do the geese pans today. And I told her that was inappropriate. That word right there to us was hilarious. Hey, bro; what the fuck do they mean? Why does she keep saying that?  We would come in the house and wash our hands and sit down. [Mimicking voice] That is so inappropriate of you guys; go change your clothes. Why would you guys come in here smelling like [inaudible 6:09] and sitting at the table? No one wants to eat and smell outside. Go.  Wait; what did you just say? Bitch, were hungry. We aint got  we wash our hands, we eat. We dont know about changing our clothes to eat. We dont know about all that. [Laugh] We didnt have to do that in the projects, bro. Shit like that.  [Inaudible 6:25 ] be like, Did you hear what she said? Did you hear what she said? What you mean? He never paid attention. Cottage cheese and beets. Oh. I hate those. She knew we didnt like those. She knew, because we voiced it. Shed sit down with a list of hecka foods or whatever. And we used to plan on what we eat and what we dont eat, so when she goes shopping we could all compromise.  Girl, I think she did it on purpose. I think she got the opposite of everything we said we dont. Man. She came in the house with string cheese. Were likewhat the fuck is that? You break it apart, you pull it. Thats cheese? Hell, no. We aint eating that. What the hell is those red things? Are they bleeding? Do they supposed to look like that? Oh my god. And then that cottage cheese. Why is that so lumpy? Oh, [inaudible 7:20]. This is sour cream. It would just be  no, no, no, no.  Then shes like, Were going to make sun tea. How the hell do you make sun tea? Shes like, Go get a jar. Put some water in it. Put it on the porch with the tea bags in it and let it sit. Thats how that  Thats our drink for dinner. Bitch, dont you all drink soda? [Laugh] You all aint got kool-aid? [Laugh] Like, where is the kool-aid? Shes likeoh, we dont do that in this house. Whoa. Yall got sugar and water? Sugar and milk? You know, were from the [laugh] [inaudible 7:52]. No. And then we had no sugar in the tea. So she just expected us to drink it all. You got to eat all your meal. Man. A pea casserole. And when she cooks, she only cooks with salt and pepper. So she made some pork chops. No flour. What? Girl, it be so  just be so .. itd be  the little stuff. The little stuff that my dad wouldnt care for nothing. Like, for nothing in the world.  I used to [inaudible 8:21] for my little sister, because I had to do my own hair. But my sister, I used to be likedamn, you fucking [inaudible 8:28]. She had ponytails. I dont know if youve seen the movie Dont Be a Menace. How to do hair was everywhere. And had the [knockers? 8:37]. She was banging it, and Id be like, youre like [inaudible 8:39]. Oh, just  So as soon as we get about halfway to school Im taking out ponytails and trying to get it together. Girl, no. It was the worst years. I dont know why he moved us to Oregon. [Inaudible 8:57]. I:\tSo you got to talk to this woman therapist about all this stuff. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIn what ways did she help you, do you feel like? The counselor that you saw during those years. R:\tWell, she helped me not to [inaudible 9:12]. And after a while me and my brother [inaudible 9:16] started doing stuff to my little sister. Like, mind you, when we moved up there I was already twelve. Period already hit. Little chi-chis coming. Hey, my momma always said dont let nobody touch your [??koota-pepper? 9:31]. Thats what we called our private parts. So I know. Aint nothing supposed with anybodys [koota pepper]. Shes coming in there. My stepmom, she used to come in there and watch me shower.

[Laugh] Man. Oh, gosh. [Laughter] R:\tI dont know. She just helped me  she helped me how to write. She [inaudible] me all my frustrations, and then going through and put it in a different way. So I learned how to write poetry. Sing. Dance. You know, run track. I was doing [inaudible 10:57]. So I wouldnt be at home. But even when I am at home I could put my mind away. I could escape. I could go to my writing pad and write, and write, and write. Because thats something she cant take from me. No matter how many times she took my little pads or whatever. I [inaudible 11:09] writing on a wall. Paint over this. You know what I mean? Like, seriously. Id do shit like that. Id write up her stairs, or something in her suburbanher car or something. So, yeah. She didnt have no choice but to [inaudible 11:23]. So my therapist did good. I:\tAfter you were taken from your fathers house, you said that you maintained your relationship with this counselor. How were you able to do that? R:\tMy foster mom. I told her I was half-crazy. And I got a therapist. And if you dont let me see her I:\tYoure going to go full crazy.  R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\t[Laugh] You told her that?  R:\tMy childhood be hella crazy.

I:\tSo about four years younger than you. R:\tI think she was about eight. I:\tDo you feel like you have an emotional or mental health condition now? R:\tWhew.  I:\tI know thats a personal question. Thats a really personal questions. R:\tNot really. I mean, sometimes. But I think  what I found out, toomy anger problems; I used to get mad at the wrong shit. Taking my frustration and anger out on anybody, everybody. I could be sitting there, thinking about something that happened to me or [inaudible 12:54] and Ill flash on somebody. But now, no. I dont think so. Not to my knowledge.  I:\tYoure not convinced by that, though, it sounds like. R:\tNo. [Laugh] I:\tIt sounds like if a memory or something comes up it could trigger that anger again, and you might go off again? R:\tSometimes. I:\tHow would you say that your emotional concerns have changed over the years, if at all? R:\tUmm  Im very less emotional. I used to cry about everything and anything. I used to think my life was coming to an end if I didnt have nothing. Or just like the stuff Im going through now. The [inaudible 13:41] now, Id have been here crying a baby. Oh my god. But I think Im stronger now. I can handle it a lot more better. Like, my mental is a lot stronger. It aint weak.  I:\tHow do you think you got to this place, where you feel stronger? R:\tPushing myself. My own motivation. My own motivations and certain memories, and certain thoughts of certain people. Whoever is in my life. In Oregon we had a man named Papa [Sam? 14:21]. My dad took care of people and [inaudible 14:23] and thats his dad or whatever. So he was in our life for a long, long time. He always encouraged me to write. Like, no matter whatwrite. And he was like you need to write a book. He was like its your life; you need to write a book. And I was young. And I was like I aint writing no book. And he would be likeyour story has got to be heard. And Id be likewhat? Me trying to kill [stepmother]? Im going to go to jail. Im like, Im going to go to kids jail. Theyre going to come get me. Hed be likeno, somebody needs to hear you. And hes likebecause your daddy aint listening. He always like, Your daddy aint listening. Somebody needs to hear you. Whatever.  We used to watch golf, and baseball. And tennis. On Sunday mornings. All the boring  the race shows. All the stuff. Every morning I used to wake up hecka early and brush my teeth, wash my face. He had [inaudible 15:22]. I remember it was Sister Act 2. We got Sister Act 2. Get us coffee. Get my tea. Get his toast. Get my chocolate. Boom, Im in the back room with Papa [Sam?] all day. Sunday morning, same routine. Im in there. Im talking to him. He aint responding, but Im still talking. Papa Sam, I say, What are we going to start on? We going to start on baseball today or [inaudible 15:42] today? Im like, I think we should start on baseball today because golf? I dont want to go to sleep. Its too early to [inaudible]. Turn the TV on. And Im thinking hes asleep. So Im likeso you can wake up now. Im like, Papa [Sam]. Im shaking him and everything. But then I feel his body. His body is cold. What the fuck? Papa [Sam?]? I turn up his heater. Oh, youre cold. Rubbing. You know? And my papa never moved or nothing. Nothing.  So I went to go get my daddy. I heard my daddy scream and start crying. I knew  I knew. Yeah. What? I aint got nobody to talk to. That was like  prior to him moving in we had to deal with [stepmother] and them a lot. When he moved in my uncle also moved in. But when he moved in a lot changed. Because he would see certain shit and he would call it. [Stepmother] didnt like that. And so  yeah. A lot of stuff changed. And I felt like he was my favorite. Thank god. Oh, my god. But  I:\tHow long were you living with him, was he in the house? R:\tHe was staying with us  he got there the same year. When I was 12. And he had passed a few years later. We had met him before, because my daddy came from California and took us to Oregon. We had visited and met our aunties, uncles, cousins, whatever. Came back out here. So we had met him before. But when we met him he was walking around, he was talking. When we came back to move up to Oregon he was in a wheelchair. He was on bedrest. He couldnt walk. And his talking was slower. And it was different. But he was still the same. He could still crack a joke in a minute, or whatever.  He stayed with a bag; a little  not lavender. Velour. A velour bag. With a little drawstring. With so many Susan B. Anthonys in it. He had hecka money in the bank. He was a wealthy man. But he always kept his Susan B. Anthonys. So if he feel like you was doing good or he wanted to reward you, you heard that bag. You hear that jingling, you better get your ass in the living room and sit down. Papa saying what you need? What you about to do? You want something? I aint going outside. Fuck outside. As soon as he go in there. And you know hes going in there, hes giving you a handful. It aint no one, two, three. Its a handful.  Oh, my daddy is going to be likethats enough; dont [inaudible 18:12]. Them kids dont need all your money. Shit, yes we do. We be at school spending this shit on lunch. Were dont eat that shit you send us with. Shit. I swear to god. They used to pack as a nasty-ass lunch that would go in the garbage can. How many Susans you got? I got ten. I got eleven. Fuck, lets go. Yes, we do.  So like, when he passed it was horrible. But we had  we still had our Susan B. Anthonys and stuff. But then [stepmother] took that. Anything we had of him, she came and took that. We had his shirts. She took that. We had the pictures. You know, she was hateful. She was hateful. So just about me always remembering him, and certain words, and this is his presence, his conversation. And my grandma who passed up here. I remember her. Thats my motivation. I dont want to  I dont know. I dont want to be like my parents. I want to be better than them.  I:\tAnd so it sounds like within a year of his passing, thats when you had the fight with your father? Or was it less than that? R:\tIt was like maybe two years after Papa Sam had passed. I:\tSo things went back to the way they were when you first got there. R:\tMy stepmomma had made my dad kick out my uncle. When Papa Sam came my uncle moved in. That was the best thing ever for us. The best thing. [Inaudible 19:41] without these we didnt see no blacks. We was the only blacks in the hood. So when they came we felt like oh my god, we got some niggers in the house. Thank god, bro. Hey, yall eat fried chicken too? You know? Swear to god, my uncle was likeI [inaudible 19:58] my ass off. Do you season it? Oh, dang. That was [inaudible 20:05]. Then my uncle was like  yall eat noodles? Were likewe aint allowed to eat noodles in here. But you know, [stepmother] just cut all that shit out. So my uncle came and hes buying noodles. Were eating noodles. Nigger, that is the project shit. I remember this shit. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  She be likeno, come make your real sandwich. Grab you some chips and grab your pickle, and sit down. What? Who is she, like that? Oh my god. Used to wake up and have banana and cucumbers for breakfast. Bitch, stop playing. Where the grits, and the bacon and the eggs and toast and shit at? Where that shit at? We look over by daddys plate and thats the shit he got. Oh. All right. Okay. My daddy be likethats good for you all, thats healthy for yall. All right. So your calories dont get stuck. Okay. It be horrible. I swear. I:\tSo once your grandfather passed away, and then your uncle got kicked out, I imagine that  you tell me if Im wrong. That must have pissed you off. You and your brother. I mean, you had to be angry. And then your father Im sure was checked out again. So it was it back to the same old stuff.  R:\tBy this time my brother was already grown. [Brother] was in and out, always. He was always in and out. He had a girlfriend. He stayed with his girlfriend. When she kicked  when my daddy and them kicked my uncle out and my brother really started not being at homewe couldnt deal with it. Thats when I, as they say, was the ringleader. Thats when I started plans in motion. No lie. Like, to this day me and my brothers and sisters  now we can laugh about it. Back then, that shit was funny  but we had a plan to kill [stepmother].  We used to watch Dont Tell Mom the Babysitter is Dead over and over, and overto try to get some ideas on how we was going to kill [stepmother] and [inaudible 22:10] life. Yeah. That movie was like our little map. But it didnt work. It was funny, but  oh my god, they had these stairs. These big-ass stairs. And when [stepmother] came down the stairs her knees always cracked. So thats how we knew she was coming. They were popping. So one day we were likewere going to get this ho. We had the little hand weight thing. Set it on the third stair. We knew she would come.  It was just  the way our house was set up, you walk into the living roomthe couch, the TV and the [inaudible 22:47]. And you walk in, its the living room, the dining room, the fireplace. And then the kitchen. The garage, the pantry, all that. But you go in, and its the two [inaudible 22:56] right here. My room, my brothers room. So the girls and the boys. These big old stairs. You lean up to  a big-ass palace. And youd just see this open space. Hella big. The backthe pool table, the aquarium, the bar, the [inaudible 23:11]. My other sisters room. The bathroom. All this shit.  So were like when she walks down shell just be straight forward. Man, she stepped on that damn third stair and just went tumbling. Woo. High-fiving my [inaudible 23:25]. It was likeyes! Whew. She didnt kick. We was mad. We tried roach spraying her food. She didnt kick. What the fuck? We were trying hell of shit to [stepmother]. It just didnt work. I was likewell, fuck it then I guess. I guess its meant to be. I guess god wants her to hold here. I dont know. Fuck it. This is what were going to have to deal with.  She had these wedding rings. It was the two; the two wedding rings. Mind you, we have all this land. Like, the whole field. I:\tYou had cows. So you had land. R:\tLike, this field plus another one and a half of one is my backyard. What? We used to have a field day in this motherfucker. Man. After awhile were like okay, this is what were going to do. We just started high school, too. So that really made it worse. This is what were going to do. Were going to take the whores rings. Were going to make [stepmother] work for it. The rings was her mothers and her great-grandmothers. So there was history on the rings. And we knew that already. We didnt care. At the wedding, we tore up the wedding. So do you think we care about some wedding rings? No. So we [inaudible 24:40] them. We threw them in the pasture. [Inaudible 24:44] they had a pasture, a big-ass pasture. Hella cows and hella shit.

And I was in Old Navy. I was in Oregon, at Old Navytrying to steal some baby socks, some baby stuff. I aint never stole and I didnt know what I was doing. So as Im stuffing the man is looking at me and Im looking at him. Hell, Im thinking he works here. So Im [inaudible] the hell out [inaudible 36:29]. I said, You need something?

But then when [inaudible 37:06] was watching [inaudible 37:07] or whatever. I didnt know he was a floor walker, or whatever. He was on [inaudible 37:14]. Asking about all kinds You need something? We were like give me this and give me that. You add on to my mother fucker fine, nigger. You add onto my goddamn fee. You know, the more shit you takeall this shit add up. Come on, now. I just had baby socks and shit. Come on, now. That was  man. I:\tSo how many times have you been convicted, then? R:\tI aint never been convicted. Not to my knowledge. I:\tSo in the situation with shoplifting, you hadnt been convicted in that situation? What happened? R:\tThey gave me community service.  I:\tAnd said if you complete community service then were not going to R:\t[Inaudible 37:59] a misdemeanor. I:\tSo Im going to ask you a set of questions about whether or not youve been incarcerated. Have you ever been in juvenile detention? R:\tOh, thank god no. I:\tWhat about jail? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tWhat was your age when you went to jail for the first time? Eighteen? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAnd how many times have you been in jail? R:\tWhoo. About five  I:\tAnd if you were to add up all the time that you spent in jail for those five timesabout how much, how long would you say youve been in jail, total. R:\tThank god it aint never been [inaudible 38:45] nothing like that. Umm  that was a week  five, six  Maybe  maybe about all together  about 20 days. I:\tOkay. Im assuming youve never been to prison. And have you ever been on probation or parole? Okay. R:\t[Inaudible 39:26]. I:\tWith regards to the first time that youve been arrestedis there anything else that youd like to add? R:\tUh-uh [no]. They tried to get me there. I:\tThey tried to get you, you said? R:\tThey tried to get me. I had  in WashingtonSeattleto this day Ive got a warrant. But its [inaudible 39:46]. I was also 18, too. But I was getting greedy. It was going in there, taking stuff off the rack and walking around for a little bit, going to the counter and returning them. Like my auntie or such-and-such just bought this and whatever, and we dont want itwe want the cash. Well, yeah, we did it like [inaudible 40:03] and had over $300. But like I said, I was getting greedy. It was just too smooth. So I did it one more time. And I got caught. I tried to put myself running, and I couldnt get away. And [inaudible 40:19] ended up leaving me all the way in Seattle. It was horrible. So I still had to come back to court and I aint never came. I never went back. I:\tSo clarify for mewho left you there? R:\tThe [inaudible 40:29]. My sons dad, [name]. At the time it was me and his baby mommahis other baby momma. We was friends. We went to school together. Her name is [other woman]. We went to school together. And we all went to Seattle to go stealing. And they left me.  I:\tWow. Okay, so Im just going to askhow did that make you feel? I know its a stupid question, but   R:\tIt made me feel like telling on their asses. I:\tBut when you got back to Portland R:\tI didnt see them for I dont know how long. I aint never been to Seattle. I knew nothing about Seattle. [Other woman]s dad and sisters, her family was there or whatever. The other [inaudible 41:20], you know, they knew about Seattle or whatever. So when I came back I cant find them for nothing. I was so mad. And then when I did find them, We came back for you, we was looking for you, and this and that.  I:\tYou didnt believe them? R:\tNo. I didnt. And then the girl like, I was trying to get yall stuff from the people, to release your property. I was trying to get your stuff, but they wouldnt let  No. You just wanted my money. In reality thats all it was. Nah. Uh-uh [no]. I:\tSo how did you get back to Portland? R:\t[Inaudible 42:10] baby dad what happened. And all the whole [inaudible 42:16] when I get thereIm going [inaudible 42:16], and Im going to do this and Im going to do that. [Inaudible 42:18] this and that. I knew [inaudible 42:21] coming, but thats the only way Im going to get home.  I:\tSo thats how you got home. So you get stuck in Seattle. They leave you. And then you get in trouble with him because of all of what happened. R:\tRight. I:\tNow I have a set of questions for you about legitimacy of the legal authorities. Im going to read off some statements again, and then you do the strongly agree, agree, you neither disagree or whatever. Somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. So the first statement is I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. [Laugh] R:\tThe hell? Who wrote this shit? These are from the Planet of the Apes? No, I aint  no. No. No. No. I:\tOkay. People should obey the law even if it goes against what they think is right R:\tMan. Nah, I dont I:\tJust give me the answer, [name]! R:\tI dont agree with nothing about the law. So a lot of it is going to be no. I cant tell you that right now. I:\tOkay. So, it is difficult to break the law and keep my self-respect. R:\tNope. I:\tThe law represents the values of people in power rather than the values of people like me. R:\tThe law dont represent a goddamn thing for me. Im not  no. I:\tOkay. So, people in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd would you say strongly agree or somewhat agree? R:\tStrongly. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tStrongly. Yeah. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tNo comment.  I:\tYouve got to comment for me! R:\tUmm  I disagree. I:\tOkay. Somewhat or strongly? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tOkay. Most police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tI agree. I:\tYou agree with that. Somewhat or strongly? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tOkay. And the basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by the police. R:\tI disagree. Strongly. I:\tOkay. And the police in my city have too much power R:\tMmm  no. No. So I say I would [agree? 44:45]. I:\tSomewhat? Okay. You somewhat agree? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. And most people in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tSo that is the end of that. I just wanted to say that a lot of people that  I think everybody that Ive interviewed so farand from my other interviewerstheir responses are very much like yours. The sense that theres a lot of unfair treatment. Not everybody is crooked, but theres a lot of unfair treatment. R:\tRight. I:\tI just didnt want to say that to you before you answered. So, [name], have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened, abused, or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tCan you tell me about how many times this has happened during your lifetime? So, zero, one to five, six to ten, eleven to twenty, twenty-plus? R:\tSix to ten. I:\tWhen was the last time something like this has happened to you? R:\tLast week. I:\tLast week? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tCan you describe the experience in detail? Tell me what happened Tell me a story like you always tell me a story, [name]. R:\tLast week we got  well, they called the narcs. We call them the jump-out boys. Any [inaudible 46:13] time that theyll jump out on your ass. Well, due to this pretrial diversion shitlike its so complicatedI have warrants that I dont know about. I dont ever miss court, so you feel me? I dont understand how I have a warrant. But. So when they see me, they be like, Miss [name], you got a warrant? Nigger, do [inaudible 46:32]? I dont know? So Im very rude. I dont  I dont know. You feel me? Dont ask me no questions. Get the fuck away from me. So by me talking like that or sassing them, it makes them want to come and, you know, fuck with me more.  So last week I said this to one of the officers. He got a little mad. Hes like, Youre lucky youre pregnant, because Ill make you get [inaudible 46:51]. No, you aint got enough money to make me suck your dick. Everybody is outside there, likeoh my god, you about to go to jail; you cant talk to them like that. Why I cant? Theyre human beings like Im human. Oh, because they got this outfit on? Girl, I can go to Party City and get the same goddamn outfit. What are you talking about? You know what I mean? I be serious as fuck, likewhat are you talking about? Whatever. So the officer, hes talking hella shit. Like  he like, So youre not selling dope today? Hell, no. Unless you going to buy me a quarter or half. Why? What you [inaudible 47:23] on it?  Theyre likedid you just ask the police if he had a quarter or a half of dope? Hey, I dont know; yall crooked as fuck. So the little officer wrote my name. He come back, and hes likeshes clean. I said, I could have told you that. And he looking at me. Hes like  so what do you do? Why, bitch? You trying to buy some diapers? Hes like, You have a smart mouth. You know that? That mouth is going to get you in trouble. I said it all depends on what youre talking about. So, you know?  Like the [inaudible 47:54] officer, he is  oh, gosh. He been around forever. His uncle is the head of the police department or whatever, however [inaudible 48:03] like that. But he takes his bloodline, his name too serious. Instead of him just being an officer, you know? And doing it because he wants to help, or whateverhe just do it because he can  I dont know. Hes an asshole. Ive been dealing with this man for a long time. Like when I first came out here from Oregon. I came out here and I was selling dope on Third. Thats when he seen me, he be like, You aint selling dope today? You know what I man? Shit like that. Or hell be likeyou aint got no warrant, so you aint running today? You know what I mean? Why you always do me like that? Thats 2006. Thats hella old. Why would you say something like that?  So, but me and this guy got history because of the fact that one of my best friends used to fuck with him. Like he was a crooked cop. He used to go to one hood and see if they had dope, and [inaudible 48:52] and bring it to us, to our hood. So I know him personally. I had a spot in Oakland, and he used to come out [inaudible 48:59] and all this shit. Like, I know what you look like outside your clothes. So when I call him by his real namethats [inaudible  49:04] for him to walk away. Or I be like so how much you [inaudible 49:11] out today? His eyes get all  all right, [name], see you later. No, no, nonah, nah. So whats up with you, daddy-o? And you know, Ill be like you still driving that green car? When [inaudible] of your other officers be likehow that bitch know about the  You know? That Skylark? You know what I mean? So [inaudible 49:28] I be likehow are yall kids doing?  I:\tYeah. How would you know about his kids, right? R:\tThe fuck, you know what I mean? I promise you, I say hella little shit. And he  it never fails. If he was outside today right now, he would see me and he be [inaudible 49:42, [Name] funny, like oh, you aint got no warrants but guess what? I know youre going to have one. Whatever. And I be likewell, guess what; is you ready to pay like [inaudible 49:53]? I got to go. See you guys later. Have a good day, kids. Yeah, all right. Man. And I am the only one who will talk shit to that man. They be likeyou cant talk to him like that. Why I cant? Man, [inaudible 50:07] my house and [inaudible 50:08] everything, huh? Huh. Hell walk away.  But it is because based on my past experience, I aint never got caught with dope. The man never seen me sell dope. Just that the group I hang with, they assumed. I was, but they never knew. So. This be a constant fuck with me. And so when their car pulls up and they jump outthey come my way, Ill be prepared to say something smart. I dont know. I be calling the one officer that looks like George Lopez; I be talking about him hella bad. Its hella shit that the other dude [inaudible 50:50], and Im busted and its foiledor some shit. Uh-uh [no]. So I guess harassment for me is just nothing. I:\tYeah. Its an everyday R:\tIt [inaudible 51:06]. It really dont. I:\tSo to what extent do you think that race shapes your experience with the police? R:\tI dont hate them, but I dislike them. So I wouldnt even call [inaudible 51:24]. Like, it took me a long to call them when my daughter got kidnapped. Like, I dont know.  I:\tAnd thats because you didnt really trust them? R:\tYeah, thats it. But I dont think they help. They dont help when they need to help. They be worried about the wrong shit. Its hella shit going on [inaudible 51:43] worry about the wrong shit. Like, every day they made a point of  they come up here every day. You see that group of men sitting outside. Theyll jump out and frisk them down. And [inaudible 51:57]. Yall know they aint got shit.

They be likefuck the police. What? Back in my days wed be like, Can we get a sticker? And yall like, Fuck the police. We going to kill the police, and bla-bla-bla. So.

      "\t I:\tOkay, [Name]. I just want to thank you again for agreeing to participate in the study. I want to reiterate thator maybe this is the first time that Im mentioning this, although I think its in the consent formthat if there are any questions you feel uncomfortable with you dont have to answer. If you have any questions about what Im asking, you can ask at any point, and you can always stop the interview at any point if you no longer wish to participate. Okay? R:\tOkay. I:\tIm going to ask you several sets of questions having to do with your background; like your relationships, your experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. Id like to start by asking you about your background. How old are you now? R:\t29. I:\tWhen were you born? R:\tAugust 20th, 1986. I:\tOkay. Your birthday is in a couple of days. R:\tTwo days, yep.

R:\tGreenbrae. I:\tThats in California? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat part of California is this? Ive not heard of it. R:\tIts in Marin. I:\tOkay. How would you self-describe your race or ethnicity? R:\tWhite and Asian. I:\tHow do other people perceive you? R:\tUsually Latino, actually. I:\tWhats your present marital status? R:\tSingle. I:\tNever married? Okay. How many children do you have? R:\tZero. I:\tWhats your highest level of education completed? R:\tHigh school. I:\tDid you receive any help in school with academics? Like tutoring, extra reading help, extra math help, special ed, counseling? R:\tTutoring. And extra math help. I:\tAny other types of assistance you received? Okay. So currently how do you support yourself financially?  R:\tUmm  I:\tHere are the categories for you to take a look at, and just check all that apply, yeah. R:\t[Laugh] Job [inaudible 3:06]. I:\tAnd how much money do you earn? This could be by the hour, by the day, by the week, every two weeks, whatever. Usually by the hour. R:\tI would say a month I usually make about $1,000. I:\tWhat would you say is your household income? R:\tI have no clue. Probably  Id say probably that. I:\tBetween $10,000 and $20,000? R:\tYeah. I:\tNow Im going to read to you some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationships with your family members, because were now moving into a set of questions about relationships and social support. So, family refers to anyone who is a blood or legal relative, people that you might have a child withyou dont have children so that doesnt count for youor significant others. Please respond to the following statements, and essentially you respond by saying strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree. You see it? R:\tYeah. I:\tThe first statement is, I feel close to my family. R:\tAgree. I:\tThe second one is I want my family to be involved in my life. R:\tDisagree. I:\tDo you mind if I ask why? R:\tI dont know. Im an adult now, so they dont need to be a part of my life that much. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tMe, consider? I:\tYeah, so you say this. Do you agree with this statement? I consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tDisagree. I:\tMy family is a source of support for me. R:\tAgree. I:\tI fight a lot with my family members. R:\tNo. I:\tDisagree strongly? Or disagree? R:\tDisagree. I:\tI often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tNeutral. I:\tI am criticized a lot by my family. R:\tNeutral.  [Interruption] I:\tI have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many people would you say you have like that in your life, among your family members? R:\tTwo. I:\tI have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem. R:\tDisagree. Or, no. Agree with that. I:\tAbout how many people would you say you have? R:\tOne. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tAgree. I:\tHow many people would you say? R:\tMaybe four. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice in finding a job. R:\tTwo. Agree. I:\tWould you strongly agree with that, or?  R:\tUmm, yeah. I would strongly agree. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tAgree. I:\tHow many people would you say you have in your life like that? R:\tI think three. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed. So just disagree? R:\t[inaudible 07:08]. I:\tAnd, I have someone in my family who would provide support with financial assistance. R:\tMaybe one. I:\tOkay. So family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that are not in our best interests, and can be sources of stress. Can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends that provide good examples of both? So examples of people who have been supportive of you, and then also people who have been kind of a poor influence. R:\tOkay. How many do I feel is positive? I:\tYeah. And more than anything, give me an example of a situation where you feel like theyve been a really good source of support for you. R:\tMy aunt, because she always tries to help me get jobs [inaudible 08:15]. But my dad maybe is negative because if Im not working hell say Im not doing anything. I:\tSo how often do you have conversations with him about this? R:\tPretty often. When I dont work, which is semi-often. But usually I have something lined up. I:\tAnd so what does he think is going on? R:\tJust  umm  Im in-between jobs. I:\tHe just thinks youre in-between jobs? R:\tYeah. I:\tBut you seem to sense it as fairly negative, and so Im trying to understand where that comes from. R:\tIts just  I dont know; he always works, so he thinks I should be that same way. I:\tDo you disagree? R:\tYeah, for the most part. I:\tDo you want to tell me more? R:\tYeah. I dont know. I just like to focus on my hobbies and [inaudible 9:28] make money. So I have to sometimes live below whats called the [inaudible 09:39] my life [inaudible]. I:\tAnd he doesnt get it? R:\tBasically. I:\tHow long has this been an issue? R:\tProbably since senior year. I:\tDid he want you to start to work pretty early? R:\tNo, just school and stuff. And I didnt want to go to school. And if I wasnt going to go to school I should work. But I dont want to do either of those things. I:\tSo what are you into? You mind my asking what your hobbies are? R:\tArt, music; you know, creative things. I:\tAre you like in a band? R:\tSomething like that, yeah. I DJ. I:\tAnd its hard for your father to understand these are things that you like to do? R:\tYeah. Pretty much, yeah. Id say that. But honestly, I dont think he even cares anymore. Maybe just pressure-wise. He doesnt really bring it up [inaudible 10:48]. I:\tIn some ways it sounds like a generational battle; like the older generation thinks theres a particular way to be an adult. R:\tRight. Definitely. I:\tAnd so based on that standard, youre not living up to his vision of what that is, and thats a problem for him. And it sounds likeand youre going to tell me if and when Im wrongit sounds like youre trying to say, There are alternative ways to be, and this is the way it works for me. R:\tBasically, yeah. Basically. I:\tI kind of hearbut maybe Im picking this upsome frustration on your part. Like, youre used to the conflict, but theres still a hint of frustration.  R:\tYeah, but I see what hes talking about. But I also [inaudible 11:44]. I:\tBesides this particular issue, how would you characterize your relationship with your father? R:\tGood. I:\tAnd what does good mean? R:\tWe talk, we hang out. We enjoy each others company. Besides this issue, its fine. I:\tOkay. So the next set of questions is about your relationships to people outside of your family. R:\tRight. I:\tI want you to think about three people whom you feel closest to personally, such as friends. Again, we dont want to include any family members or partners that you might have. R:\tRight. I:\tSo how many friends, up to three, do you feel closest to? R:\tId say three. I:\tLets talk about the first person. Male or Female? R:\tMale. I:\tHow would you describe his race or ethnicity? R:\tWhite and Arab. I:\tAnd what is his age? R:\t[29? 12:47] I:\tAnd whats the highest level of education hes gotten? R:\tCollege. I:\tSo he graduated? R:\tYeah, I think so. I:\tIs he currently working for pay? R:\tYeah. I:\tTo your knowledge, is he receiving public assistance of any kind? R:\tNo. I:\tIs he married or living with a partner? R:\tSingle. I:\tNow lets talk about the second person. Is it a male or female? R:\tFemale. I:\tHow would you describe her race or ethnicity? R:\tJewish. [Laugh] I:\tAnd whats her age? R:\t29. I:\tSo are these people that you grew up with, went to school with? Or, you met them afterward? R:\tNo, I met them afterwardsyeah. I:\tAnd what is her highest level of education completed? R:\tCollege. I:\tIs she currently working for pay? R:\tNo. I:\tIs she receiving any kind of public assistance? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd is she currently married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd the third person. Is it a male or female? R:\tFemale. I:\tHow would you describe her race or ethnicity? R:\tAsian. I:\tAnd whats her age? R:\t[23? 14:11] I:\tAnd whats her highest level of education? R:\tHigh school. I:\tAnd is she currently working for pay? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you know if shes receiving any public assistance? R:\tShe is. I:\tIs she married or living with a partner? Okay.  So now Im going to ask you some questions about groups or organizations that you might belong to. And Im particularly interested in the extent to which they provide you with any kind of emotional or material supportmeaning they can give you things to help you along the way. R:\tRight. I:\tI am going to just list them out and you tell me if youre a member. R:\tOkay. I:\tChurch, synagogue, mosque? Recreational club? Sports team? Music, or art group? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd how often do you participate in this? Daily, weekly? R:\tDaily. I:\tWould you be able to turn to this group for emotional support? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd would you be able to turn to this group if you needed something like money, information, job? R:\tYeah, definitely. I:\tOkay. A crew or a gang? Local government? R:\tNo. I:\tCivic association? Support group? R:\tNo. I:\tAny kind of other organization or  Now Im going to ask you Actually, before we get to these questions about employment, can you tell me a little bit more about the music or artist group that you belong to, that youre a part of? R:\tWe do like paintings and music performances. I:\tYou said paintings and music performances? R:\tYeah. I:\tAll at the same time? How does this work? R:\tIts different mediums. DJ-ing in art galleries, and performing. I:\tHowd you get into it? R:\tJust met people. Mutual friends. I:\tIs it something that you sought out? How do you come to learn about these groups that youve become a part of? Because I wouldnt know. I probably dont even know the kind of thing that youre talking about, that it exists, right? R:\tRight. I:\tHow do you happen onto it? R:\tHmm. I dont know. Honestly, I dont know. I just put out that energy and always did art, and then met other people that liked doing it and collaborated. I:\tThat actually sounds really very cool. R:\tIts nice. I:\tI might at some point, go back to learn more about that. But lets start asking questions about employment now. I am going to ask you some questions about your employment history. How old were you when you had your first job? R:\t13. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life would you say youve been employed? All, most, some, little, none? R:\tSome. I:\tAnd what skills do you bring to the labor market? How would you describe your skill set? R:\tI have worked in radio. Ive worked in construction. And  I guess, art. I:\tWhen you worked in radio, what did you do? Were you a DJ? R:\tI was a DJ, but we also produced NPR-style radio. Like, stories. It was like a youth group. I:\tAnd then construction; what kind of work did you do? R:\tPainting, basic construction with saws, nailing, all of that. Just really basic. I:\tIm assuming that you learned many of these skills on the job? R:\tAlso through my dad, too, because hes in that field. I:\tHes in construction? R:\tHes in plumbing, but he also can do some of that. I:\tI was going to say that my fathers a plumber too, but he would be upset if I said that. Hes actually a steamfitter, and steamfitters dont   R:\tDont do any of that? I:\tWell, they dont like to be called plumbers, because they see plumbers somehow as slightly less than they are. R:\tMy dad is like a [inaudible 18:54]. But hes a plumber by profession. I:\tSo what, if any, skills are you trying to learn now? Or would like to learn in the future? R:\tThats a good question. I just want to learn how to play more instruments. I dont play any. But I can DJ. Thats what I want to learn [inaudible 19:23]. I:\tIn line with that, what are your future goals? Like, what is it that you want to do? If we were imagining where you would want to be in a year from now. R:\tRight, right. Just doing paintings and maybe clothing design. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Clothing design, too? When did that interest emerge? R:\tWhen I was young; like, teenage years. I:\tAnd what inspired that? R:\tI just appreciate it. I:\tLike, you see people and what theyre wearing and youre like, I can do that. R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you have solid plans on moving forward with regards to clothing design, or moving forward with regards to learning how to play instruments? R:\tYeah. I:\tTell me your plan for learning how to play instruments. What instruments are you interested in? R:\tYeah, I want to start a band. Basically, Im going to  my friend teach me, like, drums or something. I:\tDoes it matter to you what instrument you learn? R:\tNot really, no. I:\tYou just want to get it kind of R:\tI just want to be creative. I want to be well-rounded, and exercise my brain. I:\tI hear that. So at this point what barriers to employment would you say youve had? R:\tBarriers? I guess education. And just I also dont want to be employed  I dont like working all the time. I:\tOkay. What I plan to put down is you dont like traditional jobs. Would that be okay? R:\tYeah, sure. I:\tThere are some other items that I have listed here. Let me go through them. Transportation? R:\tNo. I:\tFamily obligations? R:\tNo. I:\tLack of jobs? R:\tMaybe. Put that, I guess. I:\tEmployer discrimination? R:\tNo. I never noticed that I can say. I:\tCriminal record? R:\tNo. I:\tSubstance abuse? R:\tNo. I:\tDomestic violence? R:\tNo. I:\tMental and or physical health? R:\tNo. I:\tHomelessness, housing instability? Okay. And how many jobs do you currently hold? R:\tUmm  one. I:\tI had one person who said seven. R:\tOkay. Very good. I:\tFor your current job, whats your job title? R:\tDJ. I:\tAnd when did you begin this job? R:\tSeptember, last year. I:\tIs it full-time? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tHow many hours would you say you work per week? R:\tI dont know; maybe five. I:\tSo you basically go in once a week? R:\tYeah, maybe twice. It just depends. I have different things that I do. I:\tHow did you find out about this job? R:\tA friend. I:\tDid the friend give it to you? Or tell you that there was this opportunity? What? R:\tBasically, yeah. I:\tGave it to you? R:\tYeah, just gave it to me. I:\tIm assuming its a he, but I dont know why Im making that assumption. R:\tI dont know. Yeah, people always say that DJ is a male run thing. But I dont agree with that. A lot of girls do it, too. And I think guys want it to be a girl. Or, like people want it to be a girl [inaudible 23:25]. I:\tWhy do you think? R:\tI dont know. Usually theyre attractive, thats why. I dont know. I:\tYou cant see them. R:\tNo, you can see them. Theyre up on the booth. Theyre up on the pedestal. I:\tAh, okay. There you go. R:\tYou fall in love, right? Theres some power thing going on. I:\tYeah, there is. And so how much money would you say youve earned? You said you earn about $1000 per month doing this? R:\tYeah. So I guess about $250 or something like that.  I:\tIs this job typical of the kinds of jobs youve held in the past? R:\tNo. I:\tBecause youve done construction. R:\tYeah, everything really. I:\tSo youve mentioned construction before, youve mentioned your music. R:\tRight. Radio. I:\tRadio. What other things? I think theres one other thing that Im forgetting that youve done. R:\tArt. Jobs. And I did  oh yeah, bike messenger. I:\tHow old were you when you were doing that? R:\t26? I:\tTell me about how jobs come up for you. Because these are very different.  R:\tWhen Im tired of not having money for a long time, I just get a job. Usually a friend will refer to me. I dont really look for jobs. I:\tAnd how long do you usually keep them? At what point do you get tired of it again? R:\tIts really depending on the job. I mean, the DJ job Ive had it for a year, and I like it. Because its flexible, and I dont have to be there every week. So usually about a year I would say I keep a job, roughly. I:\tAnd then how long do you go without? R:\tI dont even know. Months. I:\tHow do you survive? If you dont mind me asking, and dont say anything to implicate yourself. R:\tNo, yeah I know that. Honestly, I have no clue. I:\tIsnt everything expensive? R:\tI dont have to pay for rent. Thats one of the things. I live at a family home. Just odd jobs, I just do whatever to get paid. I:\tSo, you do jobs, its just not necessarily the 9:00 to 5:00. R:\tI worked for the city recently. I did department of elections; I worked the primaries. I had that job for, I dont know, a month. Setting up, making sure everything is wheelchair accessible. And then theres a job waiting for the election. So I have little things lined up if I want to work, but I usually dont. I:\tIm assuming that you save some of what you earned. No? Not saving? R:\tYou know, I do save. Yeah, I do. No, thats right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I do save. I:\tBecause even if you dont have money, you still have to eat and brush your teeth. R:\tBe alive. Yeah. When I work, I save. And then I just live off that usually for a little bit, and then when it gets low Ill work again. I:\tDo you ever get money from family members or friends to help get through a week or whatever? R:\tNo. I:\tSo its really all R:\tFriends. I:\tIts based in whatever money you can get from little odd jobs you take here and there? R:\tYeah. I:\tIts just hard to imagine in this area being able to do that, because its so expensive, but I guess if you dont have to worry about rent. R:\tIm from the area so Im comfortable being alive. I did it in New York City, too. I:\tWow. How long did you live in New York? R:\tFor like a year, total. I:\tWhat brought you out there? Music? R:\tA girl. I:\tAnd then when that ended you came back? Or, did it?  R:\tYeah, she was in school. It was a year of school, and then we just moved back. I:\tSo in general, describe your experiences in the job market so far. Youve told me about what types of jobs youve had and how much you earned. Why dont you tell me in general terms, whats been the most positive work experience that youve had? And what made that experience positive for you? R:\tProbably the radio, because it wasnt physical laborand it was all my ability to express myself. I felt appreciated. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. How did you feel appreciated? How were you shown that you were appreciated? R:\tWell, it started off as a  Im blanking on the word. When you dont get paid. Apprentice. I:\tAn internship? R:\tInternship? And then I got paid. So most people that were part of the program didnt move up, but I workedso then I got the job. And they just always vocalized that I was a good worker, and that I produced good stories. I:\tCan you tell me about one of the stories you produced that really stands out to you? No, seriously. R:\tI dont really want to talk about it, but  I dont know. I:\tBut you enjoyed the experience. You got a lot out of it. R:\tI enjoyed it, yeah. I:\tAnd so why did it end? R:\tThe youth group ended. Well, it was in the North Bay. And I was commuting up there, and then I just wanted to just cut ties from being up there anymore. Because I just didnt want to go up there anymore. Then also, the youth group ended. The funding stopped. I wouldve maybe still worked there if it was still going on. It was positive. I:\tHad you considered at any point continuing on with producing? R:\tRadio, yes. I:\tYeah, since you were good at it.  R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd enjoyed it. R:\tYeah, yeah. So I had another internship with a more  like mainstream radio station, and I didnt like the way it was run at all. I:\tSo it was a very different experience than the one you had. R:\tVery, yeah. It was very cut and dry. Very business [inaudible 30:41]. I didnt like it. So I stopped doing it. But I was interested in continuing doing it. I still am. Im still open to that idea. I:\tAnd so now I want to ask you about one of your more negative work experiences. R:\tOh, man. I:\tCan you tell me about one of those? Just pick one, and tell me what made it negative for you. R:\tI worked at UPS. There is just no creative outlet. It was a terrible job. Bad boss, not appreciated. All that. Money was okay, but it was just  I had to quit. I:\tHow was the boss terrible? R:\tJust not appreciative, angry. You know, all that stuff. Stuff I dont want to be around. People say theres a difference between a boss and like a manager. You know? So like, he was a boss. I:\tSounds like he was pretty miserable, too. R:\tI think he was, yeah. Actually, it made me realize a lot of people are trapped within that life, and Im glad that Im not. Because I dont care about  the stuff that people  need to feel comfortable withlike money and food and all the other stuff. I dont care. Some people arent strong enough to live their own lives, so they have to [inaudible 32:15] like that, and be sad. I:\tI imagine that a lot of people, when they meet you or come to know youthats difficult for them to deal with, because they have accepted, on some level, that this is what were supposed to do. And its often a lot of struggle and youre not necessarily going to be happy, but this is what youre supposed to do. R:\tExactly. I:\tAnd so theyre confronted with you. You must challenge their way of thinking about the world. How do people respond to you? And how does that affect you? Does that make sense? R:\tYeah, of course. Yeah, its just  its their own pressures put on me, you know? But its their job. But I dont believe in it. I just dont believe in it. And I always struggle, but its okay, toobecause Ive learned from when I was youngerfrom when I really had no money all the timethat you should take a little time out of your life to make a little money so you can have enough to survive, basically. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. How do you think that youve gotten to this place? Because youre hardly the only person who struggles with the idea, right? That we shouldnt  this is our lives. Its going to be over at some point, you want to be happy in itand wish people would just suck it up and do the crap work or whatever to get through. And youve said no. Im sure it was a process, but how did this process unfold for you such that youre in the place you are now? Its really interesting to me. R:\tIn high school or school, I was on one path of academicwhere I could tell what my life was going to be like, basically; where I was going to do well in school, go college. And then after college get a job. And in these honors classes and stuff like that, I saw that the kids were not necessarily the smartest kids, but the most obedient. I made either a subconscious or conscious decision to stop going to school. Because I didnt want to do it anymore. I:\tHow old were you then? R:\t15 or 16. I didnt want the life of my parentswhich they did not seem also happy with. I wanted to pursue doing art and other things that arent necessarily  supported. I kind of removed myself from society at that point. I went to a different high school, where theres no stimulation at all. That was definitely a turning point in my life. I remember making the decision and Im still with that, because I made my brain dislike that normal stuff, I guess. I:\tWith the new high school, how did that come about? Was it your parents saying youve to do something? R:\tNo, no. I was kicked out of school, and then I went to a continuation school. Its so funny my journey. But like in pre-calculus and all that as a sophomore, theres only maybe ten kids in our school that were at that level. Probably like five, actually. Then all of a sudden Im in this other school where the highest class you can do is geometry. So I was likeall right, Ive already done the highest thing at this school. Theres no stimulation. Its just babysitting.  But I dont know  I just also like  I dont believe in classes [inaudible 36:45 ] youre smarter than this person. I learned it from that school, also but in different ways. I:\tYou said that you were kicked out. R:\tYeah. I:\tTell me about that. R:\tI just didnt go to school. I was truant. Truancy, thats the term. And I made the decision not to go to school. I:\tWas that associated with any other behaviors, or was it just that you just stopped going? Sometimes when kids get to a place where they R:\tI just didnt agree with what  I didnt like the teachers. I didnt like the attitudes. I didnt like all that. The only class I liked was webpage design, because I felt like it was a real class and it spoke to me. All the other classes I felt were basically lies, you know? I:\tAnd how did your parents respond? R:\tNot happy, obviously. Concerned. I:\tWhat was the concern? R:\tThat my life would be crazy afterwards. I:\tIt wasntis our son depressed?  R:\tNo, it was that. Yeah, I had to go to therapy. And there was certain things because of that I had to do, which I resisted also. Yeah; they were concerned, and mad at me that I made that decision. But it was also my life. I was taking control. Thats what I wanted. I:\tIm trying to imagine what my parents would have done in that situation. I think they would have been likeyouve got to go to school or youve got to get out. My parents were the kind of ultimatum type of parents. R:\tIt was basically coming to that. And a lot of fights, a lot of [inaudible 38:39]. Likeyoure going to live with this family member. But it never would go down. I:\tDid that just make it worse for you? Did it just make you want to dig your heels in more? On some level, I imagine you want to make your parents happy, right? Or at least have them be proud of you. So on some level, I could see it would be a struggle for youbecause you want to do your thing, but its not consistent with what they want for you. I imagine it has to be hard. You tell me. R:\tUmm  I just had a vision in my mind of what I wanted to do. At this point in my life, Ive done a lot of those things. I feel fine with it now, and I dont think about that too much anymore. I:\tOne last question about that; how long has it taken you to get to this place where you  R:\tFeel okay about it? I:\tYeah. R:\tI always felt okay. It was other people. So I had to deal with their feelings about it. I dont know. Its in the past now. Its a long time ago. I:\tIs there anything else about that that youd like to share with me before I move onto the next topic? R:\tNo. I:\tThe following questions are about substance abuse. I want you to remember that all responses that you provide will be kept private. And again, you dont have to answer any questions you dont want to. Have you ever had a drinking and/or drug problem? R:\tNo. I:\tThats the end of that section. The next one is about mental/emotional health issues. And the same things apply. Have you ever been told by a mental health professionallike a psychiatrist, social worker, etc., whatever you fill in the gapthat you had a mental or emotional condition, or that you showed symptoms of a mental or emotional condition? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd what was your diagnosis? R:\tADD and bipolar. I:\tAnd so at what point were you diagnosed as having ADD and bipolar? Im assuming that those are two different time periods? R:\tRight, it was two different people. I think ADD was 18 or something? And bipolar was probably 16 or something like that. I:\t16? R:\t15, 16. I dont  I:\tThats pretty young. R:\tYeah. I:\tSorry. R:\tIts okay. I:\tPeople usually dont get diagnosed with bipolar until theyre in their late 20s or something. R:\tWell, my moms family has history of that, so then I feel like they were looking. But I dont believe in that either, honestly. I:\tYou dont believe that it exists? Or you dont believe you have it? R:\tBoth. I:\tWhen people get diagnosed with things like mood disorders, theyre often given prescriptionslike lithium and those kinds of things. Were you ever prescribed meds to take? R:\tAdderall. I:\tWas that for the ADD, though? R:\tYeah. I:\tNothing for the bipolar? R:\tNo. It was just basically a diagnosis. And then they just started a therapy process. They never gave me  I:\tAny meds to go with it. So it was talk therapy that you did. R:\tYeah. I:\tHow long did you do that? R:\tI dont even know. I try to block that out. Maybe a year total. I:\tThats a long time. R:\tThroughout my life. I:\tOkay, total. Have you ever thought that you had any kind of mental or emotional condition? R:\tNo. I:\tSo Im assuming youve not thought that you have a learning disorder or anything like that. R:\tNo. I:\tSo what do you think is going on in terms of people thinking something is up with you? The ADD, bipolar? Im sure you have a theory as to why people are thinking about you in this way. R:\tBasically, what we just talked about. The high school thing. I think it was normal for the way I acted. I think its my path, or my life. And I dont think theres anything wrong with that. I think I feel more  extremes than other people, which maybe people think is bipolar. But I think maybe Im just more sensitive, or in touch with how I feel. I dont know. I dont know.  Honestly, I think its other peoples problems. But I feel like I  basically, my younger brother said to me, he was likewhen we were younger, you were bad-crazy but now youre good-crazy. And I worked it out for myself. Im happy, pretty much. I:\tWhat was bad-crazy about it? R:\tBeing emotional, not doing what my parents wanted me to do. Fighting with my brothers. Stuff like that, which I feel like everyone goes through if they have siblings. I:\tCan you say a little bit more about the extremes that people pointed to? R:\tBasically, I was just unhappy living in the North Bay. Parents divorce. And be forced to go to school and all these things. I wanted to get out and already be in the world. And I felt trapped, frustrated. And then once I was an adult all those feelings went away. Because I was [inaudible 45:20].  I:\tAnd since then has anyone had any reason to sayhey now, you might want to check yourself out. What it sounds like is that once you got the chance to live your life the way you wanted to live it R:\tYeah, right. Umm  I guess so. Like I said, just  I dont think theres anything wrong with being [inaudible 45:56] and being passionate about what you believe in. I:\tYou have taken meds, because youve taken it for the ADD. Have you ever been admitted to a mental hospital? R:\tNo. I:\tYou have received counseling. R:\tYeah. I:\tFor about a year total throughout your life. R:\tSomething like that. I:\tI know that you said you blocked out your experience of therapy, but in general terms can you describe what that has been like for you over the years? Have you ever found it helpful? R:\tNo. Id rather just talk to my friends who are close to me, instead of someone whos being paid to talk to me. I:\tSo its in part because you think that those kind of intimate discussions should happen with people who  R:\tYeah, of course. I like to invest my memories with my friends. Why would I tell someone who is probably going to be gone at one point? It doesnt make sense. I:\tAnd in the middle of a conversation be likeokay, time is up. R:\tYeah. No, its really like that. I:\tOh, I know. Ive been through it a few times myself. Its weird. R:\tIts not for me. It never was. I wouldnt be opposed to it, but actually I just dont believe it, the principle. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. It sounds like in general, some of the issues that you had when you were an adolescent have resolved themselves to the extent that you can live your life in a way that feels more authentic for you. R:\tYeah. I:\t But you still experience ups and downs, but that is a result of being a fairly passionate person who gets to do the kinds of things that he wants to do. R:\tTrade off. I:\tAnd it also sounds to me like you think that  Its because people have difficulty dealing with who you are as a person that they are confronting you with this idea that something is wrong with you. So their issues becomes your issue in that way, is how Im understanding it.  R:\tYeah, thats generally how I feel. I really just feel like people  most people dont have any individualism. That when they see that it either makes them happy or sad. Or jealous.  I:\tIt could be both. R:\tYeah. I:\tRight? R:\tI honestly dont know. I:\tIs there anything else that youd like to add about this? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. So the next set of questions deal with your experience with the criminal justice system. Youre likeits about time. R:\tRight. You profiled me a little bit. I:\tRight. Well, it helps to have a sense of who you are. R:\tIts connected. I:\tYeah. So now I want to first learn about your interactions with the police. These questions may be sensitive and emotional to answer, so remember that youre not required and all that other stuff. R:\tActually, can I go to the bathroom?  [Interruption] I:\tOkay, were back. So approximately how many times have you been arrested? R:\tUmm  I have no clue. Maybe  Arrested just means detained, right? I:\tYeah. Youre read your rights. Im assuming you get handcuffed? R:\tRoughly like five or six. I:\tAnd what offenses have you been arrested for? Just check off each one that applies for you. R:\tJust this one. And vandalism. I:\tAnd how old were you when you were first arrested? R:\tProbably like 19. I:\tCan you describe the event of your arrest from the moment that you were approached by officers and taken into custody until you were released? What happened? Tell me about that experience. R:\tIt was like  Actually, I dont remember. I:\tYou dont remember? R:\tNo. I:\tWas that for drug possession or was it for vandalism? Do you remember that? R:\tVandalism. I:\tCan I ask you a couple of questions to see if I can jog your memory? R:\tYeah. I:\tWas it still in the North Bay? Was it still when you were living in the North Bay? R:\tNo, it was here, San Francisco. I:\tWere you hanging out with friends? R:\tYeah, basically. I:\tWere you high on stuff at the time? R:\tNo. I:\tDid it happen during the day? During night? R:\tNight. I:\tAnd were you vandalizing? Im assuming that you were spray-painting or something like that. R:\tNo. I:\tSo, you werent actually vandalizing anything? R:\tNo. I:\tBut the police came by. R:\tYeah. I:\tWere you in a group then? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo that might have attracted them to you? R:\tRight, right. I:\tSo what made them claim vandalism?  R:\tSome people had some stuff on them. I didnt have anything on me, though. I:\tSo they trumped up a charge. R:\tWell, we were all together. Yeah. I:\tOkay. Have you ever been convicted of a crime? R:\tNo. [Interruption] I:\tSo the next set of questions is in reference to your experiences with incarceration and/or parole. Have you ever spent any time in juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tJail? R:\tJust like overnight. I:\tHow old were you? Were you 19 then? R:\tYeah. I:\tJust the one time? R:\tMaybe like five times. I:\tAnd the total amount of time that you spent in jail then? R:\tMaybe two weeks. I:\tTwo weeks. Okay. No time in prison? No probation or parole? Okay. Is there anything else that youd like to add about that? Okay.  So now Im going to ask you a set of questions about your sense of the legitimacy of legal authorities. Here again, youre going to do the strongly agree to strongly disagree thing. This first statement is, I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. I feel like I can answer this for you. Like, I know what you would say. R:\tDisagree. I:\tStrongly, or? R:\tStrongly. I:\tPeople should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tDisagree. I:\tStrongly, or just  R:\tVery strongly, actually. I:\tIt is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tJust disagree. I:\tThe law represents the values of the people in power rather than the values of people like me. R:\tAgree. I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tAgree. I:\tSomewhat or strongly? R:\tJust somewhat. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tAgree. I:\tStrongly or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tDisagree. I:\tStrongly? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tMost police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tNeutral. I:\tThe basic rights of citizens in my city are well protected by the police. R:\tDisagree. I:\tSomewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tThe police in my city have too much power. R:\tAgree. I:\tMost police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tAgree. I:\tStrongly or somewhat? R:\tStrongly. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned? R:\tYes, yes. I:\tHow many times would you say this has happened to you during your lifetime? R:\tI dont even know. I:\tSo its not zero. One to five times? R:\tYeah. I:\tSix to ten? R:\tMaybe six to ten. I:\tWhen was the last time this happened? R:\tUmm  I dont even know. Maybe a year ago. I:\tCan you describe that experience for me in detail to the extent that you remember? R:\tThe worst one that ever happened was I was in my neighborhood right here. I took the bus home. And it was cold, it was foggy, and I had my hood on. I just didnt want to be in the cold walkingso I was running home. And the police stopped me literally for no reason. I wasnt doing anything wrong. They [inaudible 57:14] and just detained me for a very long time, and all I wanted to do was go home. And I felt that if I looked a certain way or dressed a different way that wouldnt have happened. It just bothered me that in my own neighborhood Im racially profiled. I:\tHow long did he detain you? How long do you feel like you were there? R:\tIt was like 20, 30 minutes. Just run around, likewhat are you doing. Where are you coming from, all that stuff. And ran my name for probation and all that. It was  basically I felt like just my rights as a human were compromised. And thats happened numerous times where  I understand theyre trying to do their job and whatever, theres people they stopbut its also I just feel like its just a waste of my time most of the time. That Im not doing anything wrong, and I just dislike that thats a policy for them. I:\tIt sounds like in part you think you were stopped because R:\tThe way I looked. I:\tThe clothes that you were wearing; so the hoodie, combined with running down the city street is what made you suspicious. Was there anything else? R:\tYes, and race. I:\tAnd race. R:\tYes. Basically, yeah. If there was someone jogging in a shirt and a tie they would have been likethats someone jogging. And I always do that; run from the bus stop to my house because its such a boring walk. And it feels good to run. I:\tAnd so when police are stopping you in situations like that, do you think that they  You mentioned that you thought that race was important. Do you think its because they perceive you as Latino?  R:\tYeah. Yeah, I do actually, because they ask me that. I:\tThey ask you if youre Latino? R:\tYou know, when they ask you the questions. Yeah, basically. I:\tHow do you imagine your situation would be different if folks knew you were R:\tWhite and Asian? I would get easier treatment, definitely. My brother actually looks more Asian, and he never  I:\tHe never gets this? R:\tNo. [Inaudible 59:41] I:\tIs there any other thing that youd like to mention with regards to that topic? Interactions with the police. R:\tNo, not really. No. I:\tThe next set of questions is about pretrial detention experiencesso the time that youve spent in jail. The reason why I had your number was because it was given to me by the San Francisco pretrial diversion. So Im interested in the experience that led to your time with pretrial diversion and the pretrial diversion project. So could you tell me about the circumstances that led to your arrest that led you to be referred to pretrial diversion? R:\tBasically, we were in court. I didnt want to take any deals, and then finally they saiddo you want to do community service instead? And I said yes. And I started doing it. And it was fine. I actually was, I didnt mind it at all. I:\tThis is for drug possession? R:\tNo, for the vandalism. I:\tFor the vandalism? But the vandalism happened when you were 19. R:\tYeah, theres two times I did it. I:\tOkay. And so you were arrested for vandalism. How long did they keep you in jail? R:\tJust like a day. I:\tYou were out the next day. R:\tThe second time it was five days. It was a weekend. I:\tIt was a weekend? You got arrested on a Friday night or something? R:\tPerfect, right? Yep. I:\tThey must hold a lot of people. You cant know how many people Ive talked to who that was their experiencebecause they got arrested on Friday evening. They had to wait until the next week in order to get processed. So I think you told me about the first experience where you got arrested for vandalism. Can you tell me about the second experience? R:\tIt was the same situation, where I was with other people. Somebody put up a sticker or something like thata rock band sticker. There was undercover police. I was just with them and then they said, You already got caught doing this so you should just take the community service again. I:\tBecause it was on your record that was a point against you, so they  R:\tYeah. I:\tIm assuming that you had a public defender. R:\tRight. I:\tCan you tell me some of the offers that were on the table? R:\tI cant remember because they were so bad. I didnt even consider them. It was like probation or jail time. I was likeno. Then eventually it turned out to just be dropped. I:\tIt was no, no, no. Which meant that you would go to trial. You were willing to go to trial if they didnt give you something you wanted. R:\tYeah, and then at the very end they said  I just got pretrial and community service. I:\tHow did that work with pretrial? Heres a deal; you can do community service. They told you it was community service. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat kind of community service? R:\tIt would be like cleaning trash. I:\tHow long? R:\t96 hours. I:\tOver what period of time? R:\tI think a year. I:\tSo you were held for five days. When you were held, what was that experience like? Because the first time, it was just  R:\tIt was easy, yeah. Five days was rough. It wasnt fun. I told them I was lactose intolerant, but every day they brought me milk. I knew I was going to get out, because the last day they brought me orange juice.  I:\t[Laugh] R:\tSo I had a feeling that I was about to get  you know, I was counting the legal amount before you are charged  something. You can just stay in jail until the trial, right? I:\tRight. R:\tI was likeI dont know whats going to happen. But then when I got the orange juice it felt like Im going to get out. I:\tSo up until that day when you were released, did you have any contact with your public defender about what was happening? R:\tNo. Nobody. I:\tYoure just kind of sitting around waiting for something to happen, and not knowing if and when anything was going to happen. R:\tBasically. I:\tHow would you describe the other people who were in jail with you during that period of time? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tWhat they looked like. My only experience with incarceration is what Ive seen on Oz. Enlighten me. The truth of the matter is that thats not that far from the truth for me. What was that like for you? Im assuming that Oz is a lot of fiction. R:\tI mean, thats prison. This is just regular jail. I dont know. Most people are in there for DUI or domestic violence. So theres a wide spread of people who do that. But then theres real criminalsgang members, other stuff. I:\tIs it easy to distinguish between the people who are  R:\tYeah, definitely. Society already does that for us. But I think also because Im racially ambiguous that people dont really mess with me too much. They cant really tell whats going on with me, and thats a plus to being me. So it was fine. It was what it was. I:\tWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced? R:\tNot going crazy. Just keeping myself entertained. Its just boring. Its just boring. I:\tHow did you keep yourself entertained? R:\tJust thinking about stuff; thinking about when I was going to get out what I was going to do. Thinking about people. I:\tCan you describe any informal rules that you have to live by in jail? R:\tNo. Just dont mess with anybody. I:\tWhat would it mean to mess with somebody? R:\tJust give people their space. Youre already together with a bunch of people, just dont touch anybody or [inaudible 66:55]. Dont do anything that would make anybody mad. I:\tLike what kinds of things would make someone mad? R:\tIf someone touched  I:\tI wont touch you, but if I get too close to you would that be a problem? R:\tProbably, probably. Or, talk to someone that  you know, they dont want to talk. I didnt say almost anything to anybody. People tried to talk to me but I wouldnt. I did at the last two days became friends with my bunk mate, and we just hung out and talked. That was fine.  I:\tWhen you were detained, were there any kind of responsibilities or obligations that you had that you couldnt fulfill because you were inside? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you know of any programs or services that existed while you were in detention that were carried out in jail? Like anger management discussion groups, or? R:\tNothing. There was nothing like that. I:\tIm assuming there were no services that you used when you were in jail. Did your family members know that you were in jail? Have they ever learned or found out? R:\tI think I told  I:\tCan I ask why they never came to know? R:\tI just didnt want them to know. Im private. I:\tDuring the time that you were in jail, did you maintain contact with any of your friends People you felt close to? R:\tNo. I:\tDid any of them know you were  during that time? R:\tYeah, they did. They knew I [inaudible 69:10]. Somebody had told them or something. But I didnt want to talk on the phone or anything, so I didnt call them. I maybe called one person, and then I just [inaudible 69:22] I was lonely or something. So I just realized I dont even know [inaudible 69:28]. I:\tYou figured out a different way to deal with your loneliness? R:\tI just talked to my bunk mate. Tried to be cool with the people [inaudible 69:37]. I:\tSo you were released before R:\tTrial. I:\tAnd you were released on your own recognizance? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo there was no bail associated with you being released. R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. So you said that you were in conversationafter going to court, Im assuming for arraignment, your public defender gave you a set of options and then you finally saidokay, Ill take that. R:\tRight. I:\tSo during the period when you were going through arraignment when they told you about these options that were available to youhow long were you sitting there talking to them about this before this came up and this arrangement was made? R:\tIt was numerous court dates. Yeah, maybe five or six. I:\tBefore you got to the point where they were likeokay, well do this. R:\tYeah. I:\tWow. Over what period of time? R:\tI dont even know. Like eight months or something. I:\tEight months? R:\tMaybe. Something like that. A long time. I:\tSo they released you on your recognizance. R:\tI have a court date. I:\tYou have a court date. You show up for your court date. Im assuming your court date is a month or so out, or maybe a month and a half out. R:\tSomething like that, yeah. I:\tYou show up. Theyre likeokay, so why dont we give you probation? And youre like, no. And then theyre likeokay, go home. R:\tNo, most of the time theyre not even ready. The first few times theres no  the public defender is looking at it for the first time, or whatevers happening. The judge just reschedules it. Just keeps going and going and going. I:\tTell me about that experience for youthis whole business of just keeping going and you dont know when its going to end it sounds like. R:\tIve been through it a couple times, so now I know what to expect. But I also expect the worst might happen. I just hope. Just keep a positive outlook about it. I:\tYou would show up whenever they told you to show up. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd go through the motions every time. R:\tThe second time is when I moved to New York. There was some complication. It actually ended up messing me up. When I moved to New York  the last few days when I was in the Bay Area I got strep throat and I was sick, and I couldnt finish the last day of community service. But I already had my ticket, I already had a job lined up in New York. So I just left. I said Ill deal with it when I come back.  So then at one point, I didnt show up to a court just to check in, and I got a warrant. So then when I came backthe day I came backI did the last day of community service. Or no, they set up a new court date. And instead of going to court I just did the community service, and I was in contact with my public defender. I then I called her and saidI finished the last day. Do I need to come in? She said no. So then after that, I was jaywalking and I got stopped. And they were likeoh, you have a warrant for your arrest. And I did a night in jail for that, for nothing. I told them I was already finished and its over, but there was that court warrant that they didnt clear up even though I was done with the whole process. I:\tRight, and she told youyeah. R:\tYeah. I really didnt like that. But they let me out. I:\tHolding you in jail, they checked to be sure that that was the case and then released you once they confirmed that you had completed community service. R:\tBasically, yeah. I:\tDuring the pretrial release period when you were going through these periods where you were going to court date after court datewhat were you doing to occupy your time during that whole  Were you just living your life? Did it affect how you lived your life in any way? R:\tA little bit. I:\tTell me about that. R:\tIt was just a dark cloud over my head because I didnt want to get in trouble. But  I dont know. It wasnt very fun, but also I would just not think about it. I:\tI guess what I would imagine then, is that you wouldnt want to jaywalklike you were watching everything that you did in case it might be perceived as illegal or you might catch the attention of police. R:\tYeah. I:\tBesides that, which is not to minimize thatbut besides that was there any other way that it affected you? R:\tNo. Just a little. Yeah, like mini-stressed about it, but like I said, I was positive that it wouldnt be that serious and that it would be fine. I:\tRight, its just a matter of time. R:\tRight, its a process. I:\tSometimes theres some negative consequences that are associated with being in that situation. Did you find that any of these things happened to you as a result of R:\tNo. It definitely put stress on the relationships, though. Girls dont usually like that. I:\tTell me about that. R:\tI guess they like it, but they dont at the same time. Bad boy stuff. But also, yeah, they dont want you to go to jail. Because then youre not in the world anymore. I:\tThey dont want the negative consequences associated with being the bad boy, but they like the bad boy. R:\tExactly. I:\tI dont know what you ever expected or thought jail would be like, but was your time in jail different from what you expected? Was it similar to what you expected? R:\tIt was easier. I:\tWhat were your expectations? R:\tI thought that it would be more dangerous, violent. There is that in jail, but it was never directed towards me. It was easy. It was chill. Just waiting. I:\tYou mentioned earlier that being racially ambiguous means that people dont know how to make sense of you and so they kind of  To what extent do you think being ambiguous might have eased the situation for you? If at all. R:\tI definitely saw Mexican people messing with Mexican people more, because of their race. Maybe like harassing. I just didnt give off that vibe, I guess. So then I wasnt on their radar. People who can tell if theyve never been to jail beforethey harass them, too. I guess to them, I wasnt a criminal, a gang member, but I wasnt also soft. Somewhere in between. I:\tWere you changed in any way by spending time in jail? R:\tYeah, definitely. I dont know. I know normal  regular people dont usually have to deal with that. It made me angry, but also it just what had to happen, I guess. I:\tWhat does that mean, that it had to happen? R:\tDestiny. It happened, I was in there. I was in touch with reality and what was happening. Yeah, I dont know. Umm  yeah, I dont know. It just made me not want to go back [inaudible 78:22]. I:\tWas there anything good to come out of detention? R:\tYeah. [Laugh] I thought about stuff. I thought about  I think [inaudible 78:37 ], but I couldve done that outside, too. I:\tRight. How long do you think it wouldve taken you to do it outside, too? R:\tI dont know. I do those things, like go to nature and think. I:\tSo you didnt need jail to do that. R:\tNo. I:\tIve chatted with some people who felt like being placed in jail woke them up. And made it so that they wanted to R:\tYeah, its a little like  Its an inspirational thing in a weird, strange way. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. The next set of questions are specifically about your program participationthe community service that you did. Oftentimes, before you get put into pretrial diversion they do a kind of needs and risk assessment. They do a set of interview questions. R:\tI remember. I:\tDo you remember getting an interview where they tried to assess your needs? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tCan you describe that process for me, to the best of your recollection? R:\tThey basically just ask you if youre fit to do community service. That youre not crazy, or you can finish it. If you have a job, when you can schedule being there. Its very normal questions, really. Basic. I:\tWere the questions asked after they had already determined that they would send you to community service? R:\tYeah. I:\tOr were you asked a set of questions before they figured out what kinds of program that would give you? R:\tCant remember, actually. Im pretty sure its like  you get the slip and you go to the office, and then they give you the interviewand thats the final hurdle. I think youre pretty much already in. They just have to make sure that youre not a drug addict liability, something like that. I:\tI see. R:\tYoure not going to attack or hurt people. I:\tThats really very interesting. Okay. And based on what you said earlier, Im sensing that you were willing to do community service because you could imagine you could do that and get it over with and be done with this. And that was less offensive than some of the other options they were presenting you with. R:\tOf course. I:\tIf you were to complete community service, what would happen? Would they dismiss your charge? What would be the positive outcome after completing community service? R:\tYeah, its dismissed, its over. I:\tSo this is getting back to this question about a needs and a risk assessmentthese set of questions that they ask in order to determine  So theyre supposed to ask a set of questions to determine whether or not or what level of risk you pose in terms of committing a new crime. But they also ask you a set of questions to determine what your needs are, so they can place you in a program. But it sounds like they decided what they were going to put you in, and they once they decided you went off and answered some questions related to community servicebut not necessarily given a set of questions beforehand to determine how risky you were or what kinds of needs you had. R:\tBasically, yeah. I:\tI just wanted to be clear about that. Did you feel that the program would help to reduce your odds of reoffending in any way? Participating in community service? R:\tYeah. I would say so. I:\tWhy? R:\tI dont know. Because its like a job. You have to be there in the morning, so it kind of puts you on a good schedule. I feel like youre working towards something positive. Its a rehabilitation of sorts. I:\tTell me about the community service that you did. R:\tIt was trash cleanup and graffiti cleanup. I:\tWhere did you do the trash cleanup? R:\tDowntown. Yeah, anywhere in the city. We would just meet downtown near the courthouse. I:\tAnd then they take you wherever you got to go in the city to do the cleanup? R:\tYeah. I:\tThis is when people put on the vests? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat was that experience like for you? R:\tIt was fine. Some of my friends were in it too, so its just kind of like hanging out. I met people through it, too. It wasnt too bad. I:\tWhat were expectations with regards to your behavior? Given what you said, Im assuming you could talk to your friends as you worked and nobody harassed you about it. R:\tYeah. It was fine. The workers were relaxed. There was no  angry vibe or anything. It was cool. I:\tWhat were the expectations in terms of how much you had to do before it was done? I think you said 96 hours over the course of a year. R:\tYeah. I:\tFor each of these times when you met downtown and then they took you to a location, how many hours would you tend to work? R:\tI think its six. I:\tYou just keep reducing it down until you R:\tYeah, they have a log. I:\tDid you have to do anything else with regards to being supervised? Did you have to check in with anyone periodically? R:\tNo. Or  the court. Every once in a while you just have to go to court. We didnt have to do that as long as you were doing the hours, and they had a report. Im pretty sure. I:\tTheres some supervisor on site who would note that you participated and then sent paperwork to the courts to keep them abreast. R:\tBasically, yeah. I:\tWas this the community involvement team thing? R:\tI dont know what it was. I dont know the name. I:\tDid it cost you anything to participate in this program? R:\tYeah. I forget how much money it was. I think it was $100 or something, because they were likeoh, its nonprofit or something. So theyre likewe need money. I think it was $75. I forget though. Cant remember how much. You have to pay [inaudible 86:03]. I:\tDid you have to pay it up front? R:\tNo. I:\tYou could pay over time? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid being in community service or having any kind of affiliation with pretrial servicesdid they do anything to address any needs that you may have had? R:\tNo. I:\tBesides showing up to the designated downtown, and then going to their site, there was no other kind of supervision that you received? And in terms of the benefits of participating, it sounds like in some ways it helped to structure your life and gave you something to do that you felt was positive and contributed. R:\tYeah. I:\tYou got to hang out with friends, and then you made some new friends. R:\tRight. I:\tWere there any other benefits that you didnt mention before? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tThe people that you met when you were on site, are these people you still have relationships with? R:\tWith friends? Yeah. I:\tSo would you call these friendships now? R:\tYeah. The people that were in the program are  I dont know. Yeah. I was with somebody last night that I met there, yeah actually. I:\tHow many people would you say you became friends with as a result of doing community service with them? R:\tMaybe five or six. I:\tThats a lot. How many people would be in the group of workers? R:\tUsually five. I:\tYou became friends with almost every  Oh, its different people each time. R:\tIts different each time, yeah. I:\tYeah, okay. R:\tYoud talk and hang out. If you can make the time fun its not really doing community service. Youre just hanging out, talking. Its just like your life normally, right? I:\tWhat were the reasons that you connected? I think Im asking in part because  I mean, I can chat anybody up. But its not easy for me to connect on a level where Im going to want to keep in touch with you afterwards, so Im wondering. R:\tMusic or sports, whatever. Just talked. I:\tAnd the staff? Im assuming you didnt much have a relationship with or develop a relationship with any of those folks. R:\tNo, I still see some of them, or one of them, but its a different dynamic. I:\tYou dont feel like theyre friend or youre tight? R:\tNo. Its just different. I:\tIt sounds like it wasnt really difficult getting through this particular program. R:\tNo. I:\tWere there any things that were difficult about being in the program? R:\tNo. I:\tSometimes people mention if they have a job, having to do these other things makes it difficult. R:\tThe only thing I would say is just that it was, I think, at 8:30 in the morning. Sometimes I would plan to go do itand then I couldnt wake up. I think at one point they changed it from only Tuesday and Thursdays, and that was difficult for me for some reason. But overall it was pretty easy if I could get up. And it was far from the house. Not too bad. I:\tYou could basically say, This is when Im showing up. You just had the year to get it done. You could do it whenever you did it. R:\tRight. I:\tBut its not like you didnt show up so were going to cite you or something. R:\tNo, no, no. Its you have a year and then you either do it or not, and then thats it. I:\tThe final set of questions about this is, it sounds like you were just about done, you had the one last day to dobut then you didnt do it because you were sick. You went to New York, and then that created a whole bunch of drama. But that got resolved after you spent that night in jail after being stopped for jaywalking. Its actually kind of R:\tIts funny. I:\tYeah, but it did get resolved, and then it was done. R:\tYeah. That was recently. I:\tDoes anything happen at that point? Do you get some paperwork that says, [Name] has completed what he was supposed to complete, or, Youre now out of trouble? Is there anything? R:\tI think there is something but I dont remember because this one was a long time ago. I:\tSo to what extent would you agree that doing community service was very helpful to you? Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree? R:\tAgree. I:\tBesides what youve already mentioned, was there anything else that was particularly helpful? R:\tNo. I:\tWould you recommend that others participate in this program? R:\tYeah. I:\tAre there any issues that you think require addressing with regards to community service? In terms of the way a program treats its clients, or addresses their needs that they might consider changing? R:\tYeah. I dont know. Like  it would be better if they did something creative. Like let them do murals or did something positive instead of just  I dont know, its kind of mundane, the things they do. Thats what I would change about it. Besides that its fine. Like I said, [inaudible 93:16]. It wasnt completely a loss or anything. I:\tRight, yeah. I actually think that that was a really great suggestion. I suspect in some cities they actually do that. Maybe not in this country. Did the program in any way prepare you to deal with challenges that you had after it was over? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. The final set of questions are about your time after you were released from jail but also since thenand since youve ended community service. When you were released from jail, what was that day like? R:\tIt was at night. I:\tWhat was that night like? R:\tWent to my girlfriends house. Was happy. She was sad. I:\tShe was sad. R:\tThat I was in jail. And then I was just happy to be out. What else? That I knew I needed to do stuff afterwards  I dont know. I:\tRelated to getting this all cleared up? R:\tYeah. I:\tIm assuming at this point, too, there was a sense that it was going to take a while to get things cleared up. R:\tYeah. I:\tIm assuming when you were released you were given a date that you were going to have to go back to court. R:\tRight, right. I:\tWhich is probably a month and a-half out, because on average I think that thats when it is. What were you thinking was going to happen in that month and a half? Is there anything that one does during that period, or thinks about during that period before the first court date? R:\tYeah, just try to be  I dont know; just live your life normally and dont do anything bad or wrong. Dont party or anything. Stay out of trouble. I:\tThere are some people that weve interviewed who said that because they didnt know what would happen, even looking for a job didnt seem to make sense because they werent sure how things were going to go. They just felt like they were so unstable and uncertain. R:\tBasically I knew I couldnt leave the area. I remember one of the times I had planned to leave or move somewhere else, and then I couldnt. Because I wanted  instead of getting the warrant, I wanted to just deal with it and then move after everything was done. I:\tRight. Can I ask where you were thinking about moving to? R:\tUmm  Taiwan. Or I think it was China or something. And then maybe New York or something. I was just going to leave. I already had people waiting; like rooms kind of set up, but then I just put that on hold and then did it later. I:\tWas it your intention to stay in those places long-term? Or were these places just to hang out for a year and see what happens? R:\tIt was like  yeah, basically. I had a job lined up and an apartment, and then those things happened where I couldnt leave, so I just stayed. I:\tIt fell through. Did you ever end up going? I know you went to New York. R:\tYeah, I ended up going there too, to Taiwan. It happened. I:\tSo it got delayed a bit? R:\tBasically. I:\tDuring this period right after you were released and going through this, how did you support yourself financially? Jobs? Family? Friends? R:\tYeah. I think I was doing construction at the time. I had a job. I:\tAny other forms of support? R:\tGirlfriend and stuff. I:\tThe following set of questions are about what access to programs or services that you had that may have been helpful. But it doesnt sound like you were offered services. R:\tNothing. They didnt help at all in that respect. I:\tSo they didnt let you know that services could be there for you and share with you what was available? R:\tNo. I:\tAre there programs that you were hoping  Were you even thinking in terms of programs or services? R:\tNo, I didnt expect any of that. I:\tCan you tell me about was there ever a point during this period of time where your family found out about you having been in jail, or was it much later? R:\tProbably later. I:\tOkay, so your detention didnt affect your family members at allyour relationship with thembecause they didnt know. R:\tBasically. I:\tCan you tell me about the initial interactions that you had with your friends after you were released? You said that some of your friends knew? R:\tYeah. They had called, and knew I was in jail. I think it was almost a cool thing that I went. You get like certain rep or something. So it wasnt negative. They were happy I was out. I:\tDid they think it was cool because it was an edgy experience? R:\tBasically. I:\tDid it change your relationships with them at all, for better or worse? R:\tActually, I forgot about thatbut yeah, one of my friends stopped being friends with me because of that; because he was scared of that part of life and thought I was too dangerous to hang out with. I forgot about that. I:\tOn the whole, would you say that not much changed with your friends? R:\tYeah, pretty much. I:\tI have the one who did on record, so Im glad about thatbut I dont have a set of questions for each friend. What type of support would you say that your friends provided during this period of time? R:\tEmotional. I:\tWhat does that mean; chatted with you about what happened? R:\tYeah, just told them my experience. And if I was sad about it Id just tell them. It was fine. I:\tYou mentioned that when you were arrested you were with a group of friends. Were any of them also arrested and held? R:\tYeah. They  I think one of the times  I forget what time it was, but one of the times  I think they didnt go to jail. Both the times that I did the pretrial they went to jail, too. Yeah. I:\tSo did that make it easier because they knew what you were going through because they had gone through it, too? R:\tYeah, basically. One time it was a girl and one time it was a guy. So the time it was with the guy was way easier because we were together. The time it was with the girl I didnt know what was going on with her, because we were separated. And so that was harder. I:\tWhere did you live when you were released? R:\tAt my house this time. I:\tHave you been in the same place?  R:\tTheres two different times. I:\tThe most recent time. R:\tYeah, I lived where I live still. I:\tOkay, so basically since that happened youve been living in the same place this whole time. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo a pretty stable housing situation. R:\tYeah, very stable. I:\tIs this your own apartment? R:\tIts my familys. My grandma died, and they inherited the house. So I have the bottom level which I pay utilities on. And then they have a top unit where they rent out to people. So, yeah, its mine. I:\tTheres a way in which then it sounds like your family helps, but theyre still  youre not up underneath them. R:\tBasically, I kind of just got lucky is that I was living with my grandma before, and I had a room already there. But I wouldnt always live with herbut it was kind of set up that I used to live there. Then when she died, thats when I moved back from New York. I didnt have anywhere to live. So it was a weird timing, so then I re-got it. I:\tWhat are the pros and cons of your living situation? R:\tPros is its very cheap. I feel like I cant really get evicted. Im sure I could, but  I:\tIs this your moms or your dads? R:\tMy dads side. I dont know. I just feel secure there. And then cons is theres no kitchen. And its shared with my family friends, so they sometimes  A different renter used to tell my family stuff about me. And I didnt really like that. But overall I like living there and its private and okay. I:\tAnd cheap in a city that  Okay. So I want you to tell me whether you strongly agree to disagree about these statements. In my first month out, I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live. R:\tYes. Agree. Strongly agree. I:\tIn my first month out, it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\t[Laugh] Disagree. I:\tStrongly? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Drug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tNeutral. I:\tMy neighborhood is a good place to liveor was a good place to live. R:\tAgree. I:\tAgree or strongly? R:\tJust agree. I:\tI cared about what my neighbors thought about my actions. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who lived there could get it resolved. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time, or I expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tAgree. I:\tAgree or strongly? R:\tJust agree. I:\tThe next set of questions are about where you live now. People often dont live in the same place. Im just going to assume the answers are the same. R:\tRight. They are. I:\tWhich makes it easy. So with regards to housing, what are your future goals? Are you going to hang out at the familys San Francisco homestead for a while? R:\tI would like to move, but its also  I like having this house because it allows me to travel. Like I was just in Detroit, but there is some sort of social stigma that I face sometimes where people are likeyoure still living technically with family. But no one in my family lives there. I dont know, its weird. Some people sometimes have some sort of problem. Kind of my dad, but my aunt doesnt care I dont think. I dont know. And the housing market is insane right now. I dont know why I would move outside of the house if I have a house already. I guess I can move somewhere more central. I dont know. Its a weird thing. I:\tIs the stigma with it primarily coming from your father? R:\tNo, and friends too. Definitely. I:\tFriends think its weird that youre living in a house thats owned by your family even though youre not living with your family? R:\tYeah. I think overall its an American thing. I:\tThey want you to be paying your rent? R:\tYeah, I dont know. Its weird. I:\tI think theyre jealous. R:\tYeah, its jealous too. But I think its my dad and friends [inaudible 107:16] talk to me about it. It just doesnt even make sense. I dont know why I would do that. I:\tNow, immediately after your release did you have a job? Construction? R:\tYeah, I did. I did. I:\tWho did you work for? Or, where did you work? R:\tJust a friend, a friends dad. I:\tWere you a laborer? R:\tYeah.  I:\tWhen did that job start? Do you remember at all? It was a while ago. R:\tI cant remember anymore. I:\tWas it full-time? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you remember the year it started? R:\tIf it was the last time  then it was 2012, I guess. I:\tIm assuming you found out about that from your friend? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow much money did you make per hour at that job? R:\t$15 maybe, or $20. I forget. I cant remember anymore. It was too long ago. I:\tThat job ended? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat was the reason why it ended? Did you quit? R:\tIt might have been seasonal. I forget. Yeah  I dont remember. I:\tIt doesnt sound like it felt like there was a negative departure from this job in any way. R:\tNo. I:\tDid you search for work during periods without a job? R:\tYeah. I:\tWould you describe how many hours you devoted to searching for work per week? R:\tNot that many. I:\tSo maybe one to five? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow many applications would you say you submitted during this period of time? R:\tProbably zero. I:\tIt was really just waiting for folks to tell you about if stuff was opening? R:\tI feel like thats the only way to get a job, honestly. I:\tSo very little effort you actually devoted to searching. R:\tRight. I:\tYou were waiting for things to come to you. You primarily search for work through your friends and relatives? Or wait for them to let you know. R:\tBasically. I:\tTell me whether you strongly agree or strongly disagree with this. Having a criminal record has made it difficult for me to find work. R:\tDisagree. I:\tStrongly or just? R:\tJust. I:\tJust, okay. R:\tI dont think its ever come into  maybe once, and then I still got the job. I:\tRight. Because they saw that there was an arrest because the charge got dismissed. R:\tThey did the search. I:\tYeah. R:\tThere was some sort of in between time where I was worried. They called me and they said  because you had to submit an arrest history or something like that. And then there was the in-between time where they were like were figuring out if you can still apply, or something like that. I ended up still getting the job. I:\tOkay, so they knew something was up but it didnt stop them from moving forward. R:\tExactly. I:\tNow, I promise you the final set of questions. Its about financial obligations, but it doesnt sound like you have very many. Have you incurred any debt related to this? R:\tNo. I:\tThat might actually be the final question. Lets see. In general, how would you say that the criminal justice obligations  and there were no obligations so thats not a relevant one for you. In any way, did financial matters related to criminal justice involvement affect you? R:\tNo. Not really, no. I:\tIs there anything else that is important to you or that is going on in your life right now that weve not talked about thats related to this general issue? R:\tNot really. I dont appreciate  being harassed. Basically, thats the only thing that is a continual thing and has been a continual thing since I was of age and stuff. Just a minor aggravation. I:\tBut its minor and constant, is what it sounds like. R:\tYeah. I dont know. I dont know what theyre thinking. I dont know what they think when they look at me. But it happens every so often and its just annoying. I just wish it wasnt a part of my life. I:\tThat being male and brownish is enough to make you suspicious. R:\tRight. Brownish. I:\tI dont know how you would describe yourself, in that way. In terms of  R:\tRight, its weird. Its really weird. I:\tTheyre seeing something, right? Theyre responding to how you look. R:\tRight. I would honestly say it more has to do with being someone who likes rap and hip hop. I dont think it  necessarily has to do with skin color. I think it has to do more with that. I:\tSo is it how R:\tYou dress. I:\tSo the way in which you express yourself culturally they associate with being R:\tI would say that is the bigger issue. Because  for white people, I think also theyre in that it could go either way. But if you are with that and a person of color, I think thats enough points for them to  on their scale, to stop you. I:\tI could easily imagine someone saying you cant control how you look. Well, to some extent. But you can control how you dress to reduce the R:\tI think this is also what  I think when I was 19 I dressed more flamboyantly in that sense. And now that Im older I dress more conservatively to a certain  Im more aware of how the police perceive me. So, sometimes I dress very whatever  button up, slacks or whatever. I:\tPrimarily to avoid the attention you get. R:\tYeah. Ive learned to. Yeah, because over time thats, I think, what has accredited to me being arrested or detained or whatever. I:\tAnd its worth it to you? I ask that, because youre a man who wants to live authentically. Right? Based on this conversation, you do so more than most people that I knowif not all the people that I know, to be honest. I think as we age we just give some things up, but that has to be difficult. R:\tIts also just your outer appearance. Its not really who you are on the inside. Its material things. So, I dont know. Ive wrestled with it here and there, and tried to come to a medium  fashion expression. But I see that as a problem overall, with some of my friends who arent aware of thatand continually dress that way. Which is their right to dress that way because we live in supposedly a free society. But also it attracts negative attention from other people, and the police. So  I dont know. Its the world we live in. Its weird. I:\tSince the situation that led to your pretrial detention experience and diversion experience, have you basically stayed out of trouble? Have you had any more contact, been arrested, or anything like that? R:\tYeah, a little bit. A little bit here and there, but nothing too serious. I:\tIt included an arrest? R:\tYeah. I:\tIm sorry. The charges were dismissed, so the prior charge cant be held against youbut how does that work in the situation where you then get a new arrest? R:\tWhat do you mean? Like the record? Im actually not sure. I:\tDid you go through another diversion program? Were you charged? Was it just dismissed altogether? R:\tIt was another diversion program, because it wasnt that serious of a charge. I feel like if its not that serious people should get that. But obviously violence is wrong, and sexual crimes is wrong. Just basic stuff. What I think is crazy is that people who get DUIs do the same thing that I didand thats like  could have killed somebody. I remember people who had DUIs had less community service than me. I was shocked at that. I was just shocked that we got 96, and then I forget the number they get, but they also have to pay a lot of money and all that. But it still seemed unjust. The crime didnt fit the punishment. I dont know.  [Interruption] I:\tAnd what was the most recent arrest for? R:\tI dont want to talk about that. I:\tNothing serious it sounds like. R:\tYeah, it wasnt too bad. I:\tIs there anything else that you would like to say before we begin to wrap this up? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you have any questions for me? R:\tWhat are you doing? Yeah, what is this all? I:\tThats a good question. R:\tWhat is your idea? I:\tSo, forgive me for sounding like an academic. Theres a growing body of research that essentially shows two things; that what happens on the front end of the criminal case processing has a big effect on whether or not people continue to engage in criminal activity or get caught up in it. If you do things like divert people, you notice that theyre less likely to commit new crimes if theyre diverted than if you put them in jail or if you get them caught up in the system. R:\tI agree. [Describes more.] [End of audio 121:02] End SF216    SF216\t\tPage 44  \n",
      "\t I:\t[Name], I have a little bit of business. As I explained to you when I spoke to you the first time, I give $40 for people who participate. And since you and I arent meeting face-to-face Id like mail you the money that I owe you. So can I confirm your address? R:\tI can actuallyIm not worried about the money. Its okay. I:\tAre you sure? Because Im more than happy to send it your way. R:\tYeah, its not a problem. I:\tOkay. Would you like me to donate it to any organization or something? R:\tSure. Thatd be actually pretty cool. I:\tOkay, Ill do that. And as you recall, Im going to be recording this conversation so that my transcriber can have it onwell have it transcribed. So the first set of questions Im going to ask have to do with your background, your relationships, and your experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. So Im going to start with asking you questions about your background. R:\tOkay. I:\tThe first question is how old are you? R:\tIm 25. I:\tAnd when were you born? R:\tOctober 11th, 1990. I:\tOkay. You are a Libra. I would know because I am also a Libra. And where were you born? R:\tIn San Francisco General Hospital.  I:\tAnd how would you describe yourself in terms of race and ethnicity? R:\tBlack and El Salvadorian.  I:\tIm sorry? R:\tIm Salvadorian. I:\tAnd how would you say that most people perceive you? R:\tIn what way? I:\tIn terms of race and ethnicity. Do they perceive you as Latino? White? Black? Asian? R:\tI actually get Filipino a lot. I:\tAnd what is your present marital status; married, separated, divorced, widowed, single, living with a partner? R:\tLiving with a partner. I:\tAnd how many children do you have? R:\tJust one. I:\tAnd what is the age of your child? R:\tHes two right now. I:\tAnd he lives with you? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat is your highest level of education, [name]? R:\tSome college. I:\tAre you currently a college student? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd when you were going to schooljust regular elementary through high schooldid you receive any help in school with regards to academics? Like tutoring, extra reading help, extra math help, special ed? That kind of thing? R:\tNo. I:\tHow do you currently support yourself financially? No support? Do you have a job? Support from family, friends?  R:\tI have a job. I:\tAnd how much do you earn? And this could be either by hour, per day, by week, that kind of thing. R:\tIt could vary. I kind of have my own company.  I:\tSo youre self-employed. And on average what would you say it is? Or is that too difficult because it fluctuates so much? R:\tYeah, it fluctuates a lot. I:\tSo Ill leave that alone. And in terms of your total household income, what would you say the range is per year? R:\tFor the house? I:\tYeah, for the household. R:\tProbably like $80,000. I:\tOkay. So now were going to talk about relationships and social support. Id like to read to you some statements that describe how you feel about your current relationships with your family. Family\" means blood or legal relatives, people you have children in common with, and significant others, or guardians that you live with. And when you respond what Im going to do is basically read a statementand you tell me whether you strongly agree, agree, are neutral about it, disagree, or strongly disagree? Okay?  R:\tOkay. I:\tSo the first statement isI feel close to my family.  R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tThe second statementI want my family to be involved in my life. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tMy family is a source of support for me. R:\t[Laugh] Strongly agree as well. I:\tI fight a lot with my family members. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tOkay. I often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tI'm criticized a lot by my family.  R:\tAgree. I:\tYou agree. Okay. So the next set of questions also with the strongly agree to the strongly disagree kind of frame. I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.  R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tHow many people would you say thats true of, for you? R:\tOh, umm  nine, ten. I:\tOkay. I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem. Strongly agree to strongly disagree? R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many would you say, in that case? R:\tProbably like four or five. I:\tOkay. I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many would you say? R:\tId say three. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many would you say thats true of? R:\tLike, ten. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many would you say thats true of? R:\tAbout three or four. I:\tOkay. I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed. R:\tUmm  Id say agree. Probably like two. I:\tOkay. And I have somebody in my family who would provide me with some financial support. R:\tDisagree.  I:\tOkay. So family and friends can be an important source of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that are not in our best interest, and be sources of stress. Can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends that provide good examples of both the good and supportive help, and of the bad and destructive, or stressful influences on your life.  So Im asking about Give me an example of a situation in which your relationships have been very positive and then an example where you feel like they may have been destructive or stressful, to the extent that thats the case for you. R:\tUmm  my family is pretty supportive of me in general. So when I was in school or growing up I always had a lot of love and support. I guess a negative between everyone is were kind of a family of alcoholicsso every time we get together we drink a lot. I:\tSay that last part again, [name]; I didnt hear it. R:\tWell, my familywhen we get together we tend to drink a lot together. So we sort of enable that within each other. I:\tRight. [Name], can you give me an example of a situation where you felt well-supported? You mentioned how supported you felt as you were growing up. Can you give me an example of that? R:\tI guess while I was in school I always had people to talk to. A lot of my grandmas and aunts took care of me when my mom was at work. Those are examples. Yeah, I spent a lot of time mostly with my aunt. Wed have a lot of parties and holidays together. We always get together. Were all really close. We live nearby each other. Yeah. It was [inaudible 9:10] contacting each other if someone [inaudible 9:12] something to talk about. Other examples  Wed go on vacations together. Things like that.  I:\tWow. Thats a lot of family time. R:\tYeah. We tend to get together a lot. Since everyone lives nearby its not that hard to do. I:\tRight. You also mentioned that sometimes when your family gets together you all drink a bit too much, is how I heard it. And how do you see that as a problem? R:\tA lot of my uncles and aunts are a lot older, so they have thingslike [inaudible 9:51], like diabetes or  I:\tRight, right. R:\tI have one uncle who went through a liver already. And hes still a heavy drinker, you know? Things like that. Like, we know we shouldnt be drinking so much. But whenever were together we all enable the worst in each other for that. [Laugh]. I:\tYeah, yeah. Thats understandable. Thank you for that. You mentioned earlier that you have one child. How would you describe your relationship to your son? R:\tPretty good. Im his primary caretaker, for the most part. I:\tSo are you juggling being his primary parent and work, and other obligations? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat kind of things do you do with your son? What kinds of things do you guys do together? R:\tOh, everything pretty much. Around the house we do everything. We spend a lot of time at home, because I give her mother a ride. I usually have to wait for that. But usually we spend time at home. We read. We play with his toys. Watch TV. Once I give her a ride we go to the park. We go to my moms house. A lot of time eating.  I:\tRight. Have you had any issues with regard to custody where your son is concerned? R:\tNo, weme and my girlfriendhave been together since before he was born. We never have any disputes as far as custody goes. I:\tRight. Okay, thats good. And what about your sons future? What kind of plans do you have for him? R:\tIdeally put him in private school if my business takes off a lot more. Try to further his education as much as possible. Send him to college.  I:\tRight .Were going to get back to questions about not just your relationship with your son, but your business and how thats going. But before we do that Id like to ask you a set of questions about your relationships to people outside of your family.  And I just want to say some of these questions might seem to be off-base with regards to the reason why I called you. But there is actuallythere are reasons why I would ask you about the kinds of support that you have in your life. As you can imagine, a lot of peoples relationship affect how much involvement with the criminal justice system they have. And what we tend to find is that people with far more supportive family members tend to do better in terms of not having sustained involvement with the criminal justice system.  So if you will bear with me to the extent that it seems like some questions seem kind of far afield, they are all somehow related to the overall issue. But you just let me know if you have any questions, okay? R:\tSure. I:\tOkay. So I want you to think about three people with whom you feel closest personallysuch as friends, but this wont include your family or your romantic partner. How many friendsup to threedo you feel closest to? R:\tUp to three you said? I:\tYeah. R:\tI have three. I:\tOkay. And so for the first oneis this a male or female? R:\tTheyre all males, for the most part. I:\tOkay. And in terms of their race and ethnicity, do they all have the same? R:\tSome of them are different types of Latin. One of my best friends is Italian. I:\tSo lets talk about the first male that you would call your friend. Would you say he is Latino? R:\tHes half-half. I:\tAnd what is his age? R:\tAbout the same age as me. I:\tOkay, so 25. And what is his highest level of education? R:\tUmm  some college. I:\tAnd does he currently work for pay? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd has he ever received public assistance? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd is he married or living with a partner? R:\tSingle. I:\tAnd what about the second person? Also a male. And how would you describe his race or ethnicity? R:\tHes Latin. Hes living with his baby momma. I:\tHes living with his baby brother? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs he also the same age as you? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAnd what level of education does he have? R:\tHigh school. I:\tAnd is he currently working for pay? R:\tYes. I:\tIm assuming he hasnt received public assistance. But tell me if Im wrong. R:\tHe has before. I think on WIC. I:\tOkay. So the third person. Also a male. And what would you say his race or ethnicity is? R:\tThe same thing. Latin. I:\tAnd age? R:\tSame age. I:\tAnd level of education? R:\tCollege. I:\tAnd is he currently working for pay? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd is he receiving public assistance? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd is he currently married or living with a partner? R:\tSingle. I:\tOkay. So thats it with regard to your three closest friends. So now Im going to ask you about your affiliations.  I'm going to ask you some questions about groups and organizations that you may be a part of, and if you receive any emotional and/or material support from them.  So Im just going to list out a number of organizations and you tell me if you belong to this kind of group or organization. Are you a member of a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? R:\tNo. I:\tA recreational club? R:\tNo. I:\tA sports team? R:\tNope. I:\tMusic or artist group? R:\tNope. I:\tA crew or a gang. R:\tNo. I:\tLocal government? R:\tNo. I:\tCivic organization or association? R:\tNo.  I:\tA support group? R:\tNo. I:\tAny other kind of organization that you might be a part of? R:\tNo. [Laugh] I:\tIll have to send you a book one of these days called Bowling Alone, which is essentially a political scientist at Harvard who argues that we no longer do things with each otherso we do things like go bowl by ourselves, because we are no longer parts of social groups with other people anymore. Anyway. R:\tThat sounds right. That I know of, I really dont spend too much time with anyone but my family. I:\tYeah, I know. I think its getting increasingly hard, and I think that was one of the points that he wanted to makeis that because of that it seems like in some ways our society is fragmenting, because we dont connect with other people even in our own neighborhoods as much as we used to. Its an interesting argument.  So the next set of questions is about employment. Can I ask you how old you were when you had your first job? R:\tTwelve. I:\tThats pretty early. R:\t[Inaudible 17:11]. I:\tHow much of your adult life have you been employed? All, most, some R:\tAll. I:\tThat makes sense, when you start when youre twelve. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat skills would you say, [name], you bring to labor market? And how did you learn them? R:\tLike actual [inaudible 17:32]. I was a janitor for the longest time. Afterwards I went to school to try to transition into IT. And now I [inaudible 17:43]. I:\tHow did the transition to IT begin? What made you want to do that? How did that happen? R:\tWell, I was one of the people that got screwed over by Heald.  I:\tYeah. R:\t[Inaudible 17:56] department in there. And I was trying to get my credits for that.  I:\tAnd what skills would you say you are trying to learn now? And what would you like to learn in the future? R:\tNow Im just trying to support my own business. Probably more animal care now. I:\tOkay. What does animal care consist of? R:\tWell, right now Im a dog walker, and I have boarding. I would like to get into training and probably like kennels or grooming. Something like that. I:\tRight.  How do you get into animal care? R:\tI just kind of got a random job. And kind of from there I got my experience. And then a few clients decided to come with me when I left the company. And then I just started going from there. I:\tThats pretty awesome. Im assuming you like it? You enjoy hanging out with the pets; the dogs? R:\tI actually am not much of a people person. Im really good with dogs. Just something about how grateful they are when youre hanging out with them. I dont know; theres no malice there, ever. It was like [inaudible 19:06]. You know, you can have fakeness or you might not really like someone. I:\tYeah. And you can do away with all of that when youre hanging out with dogs. R:\tYes. Because the worst that happens is like maybe one tries to run away, or they get in a dog fight. But thats the worst part of your day, right? I:\tRight. [Name], do you have any barriers to employment? So for instancelike, education, training, transportation, family obligations. Those kinds of things. R:\tAll of them, I suppose. I:\tSo let me go through the list, thenand Ill check them off as they apply to you. So would you say education, training and experience? R:\tYeah. I:\tTransportation? R:\tYes. I:\tFamily obligations? R:\tYes. I:\tWould you say one of your barriers might be the lack of jobs in the economy? R:\tUmm  [inaudible 20:05] lack of jobs. More lack of applicable jobs for me. I:\tRight. Ill have to make note of that.  I:\tEmployer discrimination? R:\tDefinitely. I:\tIs your criminal record a barrier? R:\tNo. I actually dont really have much of one, besides the pretrial thing, and then [inaudible 20:29]. I:\tSo is it because it was dismissed once you went through pretrial diversion? R:\tWell, I think it was a misdemeanor either way. But Im not quite sure. But nothing ever popped up for a job, so no employer has ever discriminated on that part. I:\tOkay. And what about substance abuse? Has that been a barrier to employment? R:\tTo employment? No. I:\tDomestic violence? R:\tNo. I:\tMental and/or physical health? R:\tI would say mental health. Im very prone to like anxiety and a little bit kind of nervous. Especially with other people. But I can [inaudible 21:14] sometimes. More for like customer service jobs, or things where you have a harsh bossI dont do so well with that. I:\tRight. And then what about homelessness or housing instability? Has that ever been a barrier to employment for you? R:\tHousing, I would say. I used to bounce around a lot. And that was pretty tough. I:\tWe are probably going to circle back to the housing question a little bit later. Have there been any other barriers to employment that weve not mentioned? R:\tUmm  no. I:\tAnd how many jobs do you currently hold? Is the one where you have your own businessis that your primary and only job at this point? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay. Im going to put self-employed. There might be times when I get quietand its because Im putting into our computerized system the information that youve provided. When did you start your own business; what month and year? R:\tIt would be like November of last year. I:\tAnd this is full-time, right? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd what made you decide to start your own business?  R:\tThe pay is significantly different. I kind of had a shady boss, so he would take giant chunks of the percentage that they were getting paid. And we were stuck as independent contractors. So we were still stuck with our taxes, all of our billsand then let alone maintenancing our car and everything else.  I:\tSo you decided you could probably do better on your own if you started your own business and brought along your own clients. R:\tYes. I:\tYeah, that makes sense.  So is the position that you left and the business that you now havewere these typical of the kinds of jobs you had held in the past? R:\tNo. It was definitely a change of pace for jobs. I:\tCan you just summarize briefly for me how it was different from the other jobs that youve held? R:\tI was [inaudible 23:39] my own boss, besides having my actual boss. He [inaudible 23:42]. The only thing he really did was collect the checks. I:\tRight. R:\tI spend a lot of time driving with this job. Picking up clients and dogs, and things like that. Umm. There was almost no human interaction besides the owners [inaudible 24:01]. Thats probably it. I:\tOkay. Now, in general how would you describe your experiences in the labor market or the job market thus far? R:\tEither working like a straight Mexican or [laugh] having to take peoples shit. I:\tYeah. R:\tThats been in all my positions. I:\tSo you felt like you were treated in a pretty demeaning way? Exploited? R:\tWell, I guess for a main one is like I had this job. And so I would  the Latin guy would be the only one to do the tasks that were extremely out of the picturethey were never in the day-to-day things. Like, they would have me start cleaning random things. Or start doing dangerous construction things. I:\tRight. R:\tOr going  one job, the only time I got hours was when they were moving and so they only wanted me as a mover. So I got [inaudible 24:58] hours for those weeks. But the entire other time they would leave me at like 12 or 13. I:\tRight. Yeah. R:\tThings like that. I:\tThis reminds me of when you said that one of the barriers have been employer discrimination. It sounds like you feel like youve been discriminated while you have had jobs as well, where they treat you like youre at the bottom of the totem pole. R:\tOh, yeah. Totally. I:\tAnd you associate that with them perceiving you as Latino. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo could you tell me, [name], about your most positive work experiences? R:\tLets see. Positives. Umm  probably the dog walking one, I guess. Kind of led off to something.  [Laugh] I:\tYeah. R:\tYeah. Because everything else has always been janitorial or retail. Theres not really much in either of those.  I:\tAnd could you tell me about your most negative work experiencesunless what youve already described is what you would call your most negative. R:\tI had a manager who was very temperamental. And so he tried to take it too far once, and it kind of cost me my job. I:\tWow. R:\tYep. And that one wasnt fun. I:\tDo you want to describe that in any more detail? R:\tHe put his hands on me, and I knocked him out. I:\tOh, oh. Yeah.  R:\tSo thatll get me fired. [Laugh] I:\tYeah, thatll get you fired for sure. Did that lead to any kind of contact with the criminal justice system? Or did they just say please go and dont come back? R:\tI think it was a please go and dont come back. I think they threatened to call the cops, but nothing ever happened obviously. Because it was on camera. [Inaudible 26:45] and everything. I:\tAnd so what would make it so that he would put his hands on you? R:\tUmm  Im a bad listener. And its pretty apparent in my face. He was accusing me of not listening to him, and that I should respect him. And started off on that whole [inaudible 27:10].  I:\tAnd then it sounds like maybe he got frustrated and decided to get physical? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs there anything else, [name], you would like to add about your employment experiences? R:\tUmm, pretty much touched bases on most of it. I:\tOkay, good. In terms of Now were going to talk about other kinds of barrierspotential barriersto employment. The following questions are about experiences that you may have had with substance abuse, if any. Remember that all your responses will be kept private, and of course if there are any questions you dont want to respond toplease just let me know. Have you ever had a drinking and/or drug problem?  R:\tJust anythingI would say a drinking problem. I:\tHow old were you when this began, would you say? R:\tLike full problem? Or I:\tYeah. Well, you can tell me when you feel like it became serious. R:\tProbably like 15. I:\tOkay. And have you ever been treatedreceived treatment for drinking or a drug problem? Or for a drinking problem. Have you ever received treatment? R:\tI think my mom tried to take me to rehab once. But I cant remember. I:\tOkay. You cant remember? R:\tNo.  I:\tSo this must have been, too, when you were still an adolescent then. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo how would you describe the effects that alcohol has had on your life?  R:\tUmm  relationships for sure. Never jobs. Ive always been pretty good about that. My health, for a little bit. Thats when I kind of took it more seriously. [Laugh]. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tYeah, probably those. Relationships and jobs[health, I think he means]. I:\tCan you tell me more about the affect it has had on your relationships? And then especially the health, because it seems like thats really when it seemed like there was a turning point for you. R:\tYeah. Before my son was born my stomach started to get really bad. And so the obvious one was because I was drinking too much. And so my doctor told meas well as me knowing it already. So I started watching myself on that. And then relationships. Ive done a lot of bad, stupid things. [Laugh] In different relationships. And alcohol tends not to help. I:\tDo you want to give me an example of what that  Because honestly, I cant imagine what that means. R:\tOh. Umm  just like indiscretions. Partying too hard. I:\tRight. R:\t[Dating? 30:10] people I probably shouldnt. Things like that.  I:\tYeah, I see. And do you feel like you have a drinking problem now, [name]? R:\tI think I teeter-totter with it. I can not drink if I need toso I know its not entirely. But I do spend more time drinking than I would like to. I:\tAnd can you tell me how your drinking has changed over the past, say, ten years? R:\tAmount.  I:\tSay that again? R:\tThe amount. I:\tLets just say how your relationship to drinking has changed over the last ten years. So that could be the amount, how much you rely on itthat kind of thing. R:\tThe big one would just be the quantity. How much I rely on it. Umm  Taste, as well. I used to just drink anything, and now Im a little more picky. I:\t[Laugh] What do you prefer? R:\tUmm  I prefer whisky. Im a big whisky guy. I like my hard liquor. But when I was younger obviously Id get a [40? 31:15] anywhere, and [laugh] Id drink anything. I:\tRight. R:\tBut it was definitely the amount. Like, back then you would drink to just pass out. And now its just like my quiet time by myself. Watch TV, draw. Things like that. I:\tAnd so if Im hearing you correctly, it sounds like youve found other things to do that in some ways may be a stand-in for the times when you would drink. R:\tYeah. Im also in a different position in life.  I:\tTell me more about that? R:\tWell, when I was younger I had a lot of things to deal with. And so Id prefer, whenever I could get away from the house or workId just go and get drunk. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tAnd then  I dont know. It was a lot funner as a teen, going out and doing stupid shit. But as an adult I really prefer just being home [inaudible 32:08]. I:\tRight. So when you were an adolescent you wereit sounds like you were escaping whatever might have been going on at home. R:\tThats a good way to put it. I:\tOkay. So now, [name], Id like to ask you about your mental and emotional health. You mentioned earlier that sometimes you experience issues with anxiety. Or you have in the past. Have you ever been told by a mental health professionalsuch as a psychiatrist, or a psychologist, social workeryou get the picturethat you have a mental or emotional condition?  R:\tYeah, they told me I had  it was like extreme anxiety. Where I would, like, create delusions. So that was an interesting one for a while. But just because [inaudible 32:57] how to cope or deal with it back then. And so you tend to self-medicate to make yourself feel better. But then, after just seeing the psychiatrist and dealing with that, it really put me on a different track. And I can better manage my feelings. I:\tRight. So when they gave you that diagnosis, did it feel right to you? Did it help to make sense of things for you? R:\tSort of. I was almost convinced I was bipolar. I:\tThat must have been frightening. R:\tIt was, actually. It was really tough at the time. And my family has a history of mental disorders, so my mom even thought I was bipolar. And so when everyone tells you something, you kind of tend to believe it. [Laugh]. And so once I realized it wasnt, and I had a support system in place for that, things changed a lot. I:\tThats good. And how old were you when that started to happen, when you started to realizewell, you got the diagnosis and started to get a different kind of help? R:\tAbout 21, 22 I:\tOkay. Very quickly [name], have you ever thought that you might have a learning disability or processing issues? R:\tYeah. I have a hard time focusing. I:\tHave you ever taken medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of your anxiety? R:\tNo. I dont really like pills too much, unless I have to take them. I:\tSo what do you do when you feel anxious, then? How do you cope? R:\tI smoke a lot. I:\tMarijuana? R:\tYeah. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental hospital, a unit, or a treatment program where you stayed overnight because of your anxiety? R:\tUmm  not due to anxiety. But I got 5150d once, and that was terrible. I:\tDo you mind telling me about that? And I can completely understand if you dont want to. R:\tIts not [inaudible 35:04]. It was a misunderstanding with an ex-girlfriend. And so she got injured, and so I called the hospital. And because  I thinkwhat was it? There was a  I had been prone to nose bleeds, and because of that I guess if the cop sees blood in any situation for domestic [inaudible 35:25] they automatically arrest you. I:\tOkay. R:\tAnd so I was really nervous, and anxious. And I guess it rubbed one cop the wrong way. And so he grabbed me by the neck. And I head-butted him. And so he said, If you want to fuck with me then Ill fuck with you. And so he threw me in a 5150 cell. I:\tOh, geez. R:\tAnd from there  they left me there for like two days. And so I went through like a full mental breakdown, to the point where I had convinced myself that I had another person in my head as well.  And so the whole police system was pretty bad about it, until one officer was actually really helpful. And so he stopped by and talked to me, and tried to keep me calm. And in the end, they obviously realized I wasnt suicidal or anything. So they took me out. But the damage had already been done to me at that point. I:\tYeah. Do you feel, [name], that there have been long-term effects as a result of them doing that? R:\tOh, yeah. Like right now Im shaking just talking about it. I:\tYeah. Its like PTSD. R:\tYeah. Its nothing Id ever want to relive. I:\tRight. R:\tBut I would say its a good reason I like to stay home and [inaudible 36:36]. I:\tRight. Stay out of trouble. Have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of your anxiety? R:\tI was going to therapy as a teenager.  I:\tOkay. Did you find that helpful at all? R:\tNo. But my mom made me do it. Im sure I had days that they helped. But I obviously did not want to be there. [Laugh]. I:\tYeah. So in terms of your emotional health, could you tell me about the times that you have received counseling? R:\tSure. I:\tAdolescence, and just in general. It sounds like when you were a teen you didnt find it very useful. Your mom made you go. What was that experience like for you? R:\tI didnt really like it. It was kind of an afterschool thing that I had to do every day. So my mom would always take me, and shed make sure I go there. But afterwards wed get lunch or dinner together, or  Im very close to my mother. So Im sure it helped me out in the long run, because I was a pretty angry kid. I:\tIs there anything that you took from what you learned when you were in counseling that you still use today, to help you? R:\tMmm  no, nothing that I remember off the top of my head. I kind of just dont remember most of it. It was a giant waste of time to me at that time. I:\tIt sounds like it didnt Things didnt really change until you were 21, and got the extreme anxiety diagnosis. R:\tYeah, it put things into perspective a lot more. I:\tDo you feel, [name], that you have an emotional condition now? Is the anxiety still here? R:\tOh, yeah. Its definitely there. I can feel it during really bad days, or when Im extra stressed. [Inaudible 38:34] keep myself in a calm atmosphere. And also, I have my son to worry about. So that kind of makes it a lot easier for me. Everything I do revolves around him, and so from like the beginning of my day until I go to sleep I dont really have time to worry about my own problems. I:\tRight. Right. R:\tAnd I feel like thats why I still drink at night, at least. But I feel personally a lot happier than I used to be. I:\tYeah. And my next question was going to be how has your condition changed over the years, but it sounds like thats what you just described to methat becoming a parent has made a huge difference. R:\tYeah. But I will say  well, one, having the diagnosis was a big one. I used to black out or do things that were questionable, and not remember it. And almost feel like it never truly happened, I suppose.  I:\tRight. R:\tAnd that always appeared really odd to me. And so after counseling for a while I was able to differentiate that and  I cant say thats gone, because Im never on any medication like that. Because that would probably alter myself like that. But I dont let things get to me as bad as to the point where I would black out and not remember what happened. I:\tRight. And so the blacking outwhat happened? Youre not even talking about like drinking-related blacking out. This is that you get to a kind of state where you just kind of lose consciousness. R:\tYeah. I:\tThat is frightening, it sounds. R:\tIt really was. I guess it was kind of anger-related, mostly. So I could get so mad that I would black out. And it would usually be for like high school fights or problems. But sometimes it would [brush? 40:22] off in the home, where I would just like scream, or just get really upset and kind of just do stupid things. I:\tRight. Were about to head into questions about your experience with the criminal justice system. But Im going to throw one final question about this at youand that is, do you have a good sense of where the anxieties come from; your extreme anxiety? Is it a function of your household when you were growing up? Is it a condition you might have expected to happen for genetic reasons? Do you have some sense  how do you make sense of it? R:\tI want to say my family has it, because I do have  its like every other generation we pull out some bipolar person. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tAnd so I will say that probably adds to it a lot. But I kind of had a rough childhood. So that, as I am now, is no surprise at all. I:\tYeah. So maybe a combination of the two; having a predisposition, but then maybe having an environment that triggers it. R:\tYeah. I:\tYeah. Okay. Is there anything else youd like to say about that part before we move onto your experiences with the criminal justice system? R:\tUmm, no. I think we kind of covered the bases on all of that. I:\tOkay, so now I want to learn about your interactions with the police. These questions might be sensitive and emotional to answer. So remember that you are not required to answer any question. And we can take a break, or stop the interview at any time. R:\tOkay. I:\tThe first question is how many times have you been arrested? R:\tAs an adult? Or minor? I:\tIm sorry? R:\tAs an adult or a minor? I:\tTotal. R:\tOkay. Umm  like twelve. Ten?  I:\tHow old were you when you were arrested Actually, first, for what offenses have you been arrested?  R:\tNever [inaudible 42:34] arrested and booked I guess would be two different things. But arrested for truancy, definitely. Truancy, assaults. Umm  domestic disturbances I believe I think was one. Things like that. I:\tOkay. Im just writing that in. So just to make sure I have the full list, we also have listed here a DUI? Weapons possession. \tDrug trafficking. Drug possession. Fraud/forgery. Motor vehicle theft. Larceny. Burglary. Robbery. Rape. Sexual assault. And homicide/manslaughter. Any of those? R:\tNo. [Laugh] I:\tYou know, I have to ask. R:\tYeah. [Inaudible 43:31] I thought you had it listed as on my record. I was likewait, wait. I:\tNo, no. No. [Laugh]. It would be a more uncomfortable conversation. So, how old were you at the time of your first arrest? R:\tFourteen. I:\tAnd can you describe for me the event of your arrestthat first arrest? From the moment you were approached by officers and taken into custody until the time at which you were arraigned. You know, the first couple of hours of interaction with the police officers in that situation. R:\tFrom the first one, it was just truancy. So they pick you up and they take you in the principals office. And that would kind of be it. They call your parents. That was all that was, back then. I:\tAnd they consider that an arrest? R:\tYeah. I think so. It all goes down on your school record and their record. Either way [inaudible 44:30] booked for truancy at least. Wait. No, once I was. And that was after a long history of truancy. [Laugh]. I:\tRight. And I guess what matters, too, is that in your head you were arrestedthe cops came and took you in. So that makes a huge difference. R:\tYeah. I:\tApproximately how many times were you convicted? R:\tUmm  convicted? Just once. I:\tAnd for what offense had you been convicted? R:\tDestroying a window. I:\tIs this the domestic disturbance? What would the official charge be for that? R:\tUmm  what was it? Damage over $1000. I:\tOkay. How old were you with this first conviction? R:\tHow old was I? I think I was like 21, 22.  I:\tCan you tell me about the first conviction itself? Can you describe the experience leading up to where you learned that you had been convicted of a crime? R:\tI was pretty out of it. A police officer gave me a concussion during my arrest. And so I was kind of just on pills there. It was probably one of my peachier experiences. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Can you describe to me the events kind of leading up to it? You mentioned damaging property. If you dont mind sharing that? And then how the police officers came to the scene and the interaction that led to them giving you a concussion. R:\tSure. It was fleet week, as all great stories start off [inaudible 46:41]. My friend owned a bar. Not a bar. A pizza shop around there. And so I was just hanging out with him, and then everyone came and we just started drinking. I kept bumping into a marine all night. At one point during our tousle a window got broken. And so I tried to [leave? 46:59] the scene. And as soon as I left the scene a cop grabbed me from my shoulder. And I didnt know it was a cop; they never identified himself or anything. And so I kicked him. But as soon as I realized it was a cop I put my hands up and just dropped. And so he grabbed me and slammed me onto the floorand then ripped open both sides of my face.  I:\tOh, geez. And then charged you with R:\tAssaulting an officer and felony damage [inaudible 47:34]. I:\tAnd so then did they drop the charge about assaulting an officer? R:\tYeah. And they brought the felony down to a misdemeanor. And then because I had no record they dropped it to pretrial. I:\tOkay, I see. So now Im going to ask you a few questions about having been incarcerated. Have you ever spent any time in juvenile detention? R:\tUmm  through a program. Never actually in it, though. I:\tSo Im going to say no to that. What about jail? Have you ever spent any time in jail? R:\t[Tons and tons? 48:05] I:\tAnd the first time, how old were you? R:\tThe first time in jail? Probably at 16. I:\tAnd how many times have you been in jail? Just give me an estimate. R:\tProbably four. I:\tAnd if you were to count up all of the amount of time that you have spent in jailthose four times that you were therehow many days, or months, or weeks would you say total? R:\tAbout a week, almost. I have great luck for getting arrested on Fridays. I:\tAnd so they keep you over until Monday morning? Is that it? R:\tIts that, yeah. I:\tHave you spent any time in prison? R:\tNo. I:\tHave you ever been on probation or parole? R:\tI was on  actually, no; we went to pretrial. I:\tIs there anything that you want to add about your experience with incarceration, or that specific incident with the police officer? R:\tNo. Just over-handed tactics. Usual police work, I suppose. I:\tLet me ask you a little bit more about that. I have a set of questions about the legitimacy of legal authorities. And so I want to ask youor read some statements to youthat describe about how you may feel about legal authorities. So here again, Im going to ask you to respond by saying, strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree. So you just let me know what sounds true for you. The first one is I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tPeople should obey the law even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tDisagree. I:\tIt is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tWhat? Im kind of confused. I:\tI think here theyre associating respecting the law and having respect for oneself. So the question is if I break the law can I still maintain my self-respect; and so theyre saying is it difficult to break the law and maintain ones self respect? R:\tUmm  I would say disagree. I:\tOkay. The law represents the values of people in power rather than the values of people like me. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tI agree. I:\tMost people in my city treat people with respect. R:\tWhatever the middle answer is for that. I:\tOkay; the neither agree nor disagree. R:\tYeah. I:\tThe basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police. R:\tUmm  probably disagree. I:\tThe police in my city have too much power. R:\tAgree. I:\tAnd, Most police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tSo have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened, abused, and/or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police? R:\tAll of them. I:\tAll of those, okay. How many times would you say that this has happened during your lifetime? R:\t[Makes noise.] I:\tHave some categories here. The first category is zero. The second category is one through five. The third category is six to ten times, in your lifetime. The fourth is 11 to 20 times. And then the fifth is 21 times or more. Really, you are just kind of [inaudible 52:10] just estimating. But give me a sense. R:\tIm going to say the fourth. I:\tSo like between 11 and 20 times? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhen was the last time this has happened? R:\tEarlier  no, a year ago on  in May. No, in June. I:\tAnd can you describe that event for me, from the beginning to the end? Tell me what happened. R:\tIt was my girlfriends birthday and we were going out for dinner. And I literally just got off on the wrong exit, and it was the [inaudible 52:47] Road of San Mateo. And as soon as I got off the freeway a cop car automatically started following me. So, knowing there is a cop behind me I stop at the stop sign, and I turn right to pull over. And he puts on his lights and he says I didnt stop at the stop sign and then gives me a point on my ticket. Or, a point on my record for that and everything. I:\tRight. And to what extent, [name], do you think that race shaped your experience with the police officer in that situation? But also in these other situationsthe 11 to 20 other timesthat you had negative experiences with them? R:\tIt has everything to do with it. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Do you want to tell me more about that? R:\tThat one specifically? That stop was a rich neighborhood. A big, steroid-ed white guy; bald head and everything. Obviously I didnt break the law. Im pretty sure it was even on his fucking traffic cam. But the first thing is to pull me over and give me a ticket. He was just dying for it to make it worse. Comes up with his gun pulled out and everything. I:\tWow. R:\tYeah. Other times, Ive been stopped for [inaudible 53:59] assault or thefts for random-ass people. So those are always funny, because they always swear its me.  I:\tRight. R:\tI get a lot of verbal smack talk. Like I said, I have a bad face for things like that. I mean, I know my rights to an extent; just take me to jail or let me go. Up to you. So it usually gets worse from there, and they get all upset and start saying all kinds of shit. Yeah. Mostly being in the wrong neighborhood. Its always that. I can almost  most times that Ive ever gone to a neighborhood thats not my own, or one that my people would be inI always get stopped there for something. I:\tYeah. And so I imagine that because of these experiences you have a certain level of frustration? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd anger? Anger. How do you cope with that? R:\tUmm  helpless [inaudible 55:05] I suppose. Nothing I can do about it. I wouldnt give my life to do something stupid as revenge or anything like that. And most of them are just doing their job, for some way or another. They just  some racial bias. I want to say they just assume that its the [inaudible 55:20] guy, obviously. If theres a robbery it has to be me.  I:\tOr somebody who looks like you. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo [name], now were going to head into another set of questions about your pretrial detention experiences. Im going to ask you questions about the arrest that led to your most recent pretrial detention experience. So could you tell me about the circumstances that led to your arrest? Unless youve already described this one to me, where the cop basically kind of gave you a concussion.  R:\tYeah, it was that one. I:\tOkay. How long were you in jail that time? R:\tAwhile. I was there for maybe four days. Probably longer, because I had spent a day in the hospital first. And then I still got a pretty bill for that. I:\tRight. You got the bill for them sending you to the hospital? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. R:\tI have health insurance, but they send you to General automatically, and so now I have a bill with General. Which is ironic, because I take my son there. But I never paid it. [Laugh] I:\tCould you describe for me the experience of detention? So they send you to the hospital and you spend about a day there. And then you go to jail, and you spend about four days there. Can you describe what a typical day was like when you were in jail? R:\tUmm  a lot of shit talking. Officers tend to just throw out every command that they have to, and you have to follow it automatically. Actually, you have to ask them permission to use the bathroom and get toilet paper. And so if they dont let you, they dont. You cant talk. You cant sleep. You cant do anything, really. The food is terrible.  I:\tWhat stops you from talking? What makes it difficult to sleep? Those kinds of things. R:\tTheres a humming light left on 24/7. And so you [inaudible 57:31] bunk beds, and I was on the top bunk. So the top bunk is literally  maybe like three feet away from the florescent light. I:\tWow. Right. So youre like bathed in light, and youre closest to the hum. R:\tYeah. And they dont let you get up off your bunk, either. So youre just stuck there. I:\tOkay. So I imagine that not letting you get off the bunk is in an effort to maintain some measure of control. R:\tYeah, theyre great at that. They really just sit at their desk. They dont really move, or do anything but [bark? 58:07] orders. And if someone doesnt listen to them, then they send in their [partners? 58:13] to just start beating people up and shit. I:\tRight. And when you were there for those four days what would you say were the biggest challenges that you faced, on a day-to-day basis? R:\tDealing with the people in there. I:\tSo tell me more. Im assuming youre not just talking about the guards, now. R:\tNo, its the  its just heartbreaking to be in there with everyone. The people there have all kinds of stories about what happened. And you know, whether or not theyre truesome of them are just so terrible that youre surprised. Like, my bunkmate was actually an old man who had gotten punched in the face. And the cop arrested him, instead. Because I guess the guys who punched himthe cop was his friend, or something like that. So he spoke almost no English. He had to take care of his dying wife. And he couldnt even tell the officers to use the bathroom. So they threatened to grab him and beat him. They actually grabbed him once, because he couldnt communicate what he was trying to sayfor like standing up, or something like that.  And so me and my other bunkmate there, he was telling us everything that was going on. Or trying. And so that way we could tell the guards a little better. But he was clueless. He wasnt even from here. He spoke no English. And he had no idea what was going on. And instead of helping, or caring about the guythey would just pretty much want to beat the shit out of him every time he did something. I:\tRight. Yeah. While you were in, [name], did you get a sense of the kind of informal rules of behavior that you had to live by in jail? R:\tSort of. Kind of more of a machismo to it.  I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tThats what [inaudible 60:05]. But the cops are in charge. You know it the whole time. They made sure you know it.  I:\tWere there ways in which the cops dealt with the inmates that affected the inmates own behaviors towards each other? Do you know what I mean? R:\tYeah. I had become really close with somebody. And so we wouldnt stop talking. They actually moved us right away.  I:\tWow. Yeah. R:\tAnd they [inaudible 60:30] most everyone. Like, if youre talkingif you find someone to talk to, or  hell, even if they just didnt like you, theyd put you in [your own? 60:35]. And so you go from talking to everyone to just being in a corner room by yourself [inaudible 60:41] the time. Because the first step during bookingthat one, theres no TV, theres no books. Theres nothing. So its literally just you and a clock. Youre expected to be there for two, three days, but not to talk to anyone either.  I:\tDid you ever get a good sense about how long you could expect to be in jail, in general? R:\tNope. I:\tNobody described  the process to you? R:\tNo. No one ever tells you anything. [Inaudible 61:13] once, and they told me, Dont fucking talk to me. I:\tWow. So during your detention can you describe responsibilities or obligations that you had on the outside that you couldn't fulfill because you were in jail? R:\tUmm  yeah, jobs. I lost two jobs to jail. I:\tSo you were working two jobs at the time? R:\tNo, I had two different occasions. I:\tOkay, sorry. Yeah. And in both situations was it because you missed work? R:\tYeah. Or, well, missed work and not even tell them anything was the big one.  I:\tRight. I actually have one question about how you felt when you were in jail. Because of your extreme anxiety Im assuming that being in those circumstances had to be really very difficult for you. And so Im wondering how you managed. R:\tUmm  I flipped out one time. Another time I tried to kick the door down. That didnt go so well. I:\tI can imagine. R:\tYeah. Mostly tried to keep to myself. But it wasnt as bad, because theres a lot of company there. There are a lot of people in booking at the same time. And its funny, because everyone just does these nonsense crimes, toofor small, stupid things. Everyone is there. Everyone has a story. Everyone has their problems. And just not being the only oneor being the only one freaking outmakes [inaudible 62:51] people. So like [inaudible 62:54], you know? I:\tRight. Its actually kind of ironic that for someone with a social anxiety, it was actually being in the presence of other people that helped you get through the situation that was otherwise very difficult. R:\tYeah.  I:\tOkay. So could you tell me about any arrangements that you made so that your responsibilities could be taken care of when you were in jailif there were any. You mentioned two jobs. Were there any other obligations you werent able to meet, that you tried to meet while you were in jail? R:\tThere was just that. The job. But once employers hear jail they automatically just  they lose interest in you. [Laugh] I just got fired all at once.  I:\tWhen you were in jail were there any types of services or programs that were available to you? R:\tNo. I:\tSo Im going to skip through all of those questions that are related to that. Were there any services that weren't offered to you, but that you wished were on hand so that you could take advantage of them? R:\tWhile I was there? I:\tYeah. R:\tHonestly, I would have taken a fucking book. [Laugh]. Just all you had was a clock. Thats it. And then [inaudible 64:19] guards. I worked out a lot. So I would work out there. And that was cool. You could kill a few hours doing that. Depending on the guard. If they dont let you. So. [Laugh] It just depends. Its just a giant  everything is out of your hands and out of your control.  Its similar to being a child, almost. But its another grown-ass man telling you what to do. And so you have that [inaudible 64:44] for it.  I:\tIm assuming that during the time that you were therethat you were detainedthat your family knew that you were there? R:\tYeah. I:\tTell me how they found out. R:\tOne was because it was a misunderstanding with an ex-girlfriend, and so that misunderstanding ended up blowing up into this giant problem. And once the legal system gets involved obviously they were not letting go of anything. So she called my mom and told everyone what was going on. So there was that.  And then the other time the mother of my child right now, she was able to get out and handle everything for me. I:\tAnd when you were being detained how important was it to have visits, phone callsthat kind of thing. R:\tPhone calls. That was the most important. I would call everyone. Anyone I could remember. But I dont really remember as many numbers as I did [laugh]  [Inaudible 65:55] was the big problem. I could only [inaudible 65:57], which is hilarious. I:\tIn the era of cellphones you dont really need to know anybodys phone number anymore. I suspect its a lot harder. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhile you were in jail were there people that you thought would stay in touch with you, but who didnt? R:\tYeah. That definitely happened. [Laugh] I had become really [inaudible 66:18] this 19 year-old who got caught stealing a phone, I think it was. And I actually gave him a ride back home, because he lives in another citywhen I got out. We got out together, on top of that. We were booked together, we hung out together. After that our lifestyles were very different, so we didnt really spend too much time together after. I:\tOkay. Interesting. And so that relationship in essence is gone now, or lost. R:\tOh, yeah. Definitely.  I:\tWhile you were detained, what things made it difficult to keep in touch with your familyif any at all. R:\tNot remember the numbers, and the guards will only let you use their phone if they feel like it. I:\tI see. At that point you didnt have your son. This is all before you had your son. R:\tYeah. I:\tWere you eventually released from jail before a decision on your case was made? It sounds like you said yes. R:\tUmm  I:\tThey released you into pretrial. R:\tYeah. They sent it up to pretrial [inaudible 68:00]. I:\tJust for clarification on exactly how that happenedIm assuming there wasnt bail? Was it on your own recognizance? R:\tWhen I got let go? I believe so. Yeah, they let me out on my own. I:\tOkay. And no bail was set for your release? R:\tOne of them was. Not the pretrial one, though.  I:\tSo could you tell me about the process for pretrial release? Can you describe the moment that you learned that you would be released, and the experiences leading up to that release? R:\tIt was a court schedule day first. I think I got released, and then I had to go to court. And then I got sent to pretrial from there. They just [inaudible 69:01] I suppose. [Inaudible 69:03] from a felony down to a misdemeanor, along with pretrial. I:\tAnd then they saidokay, youre free to go but you have to show up to pretrial diversion and participate in some programs? R:\tYeah. And that itself was a pretty big joke as well. I:\tTell me about that whole thing. How did they determine which program you would participate in, and that kind of thing? R:\tThey went with anger management. And so I had gone to a classthe same thing; people that did almost nothing. Some of them were pretty crazy, obviously. But most of them were mostly minor things, as like hitting a car or  it was just The big part of itand I actually learned this with the judgewas that they didnt care if you did pretrial. They wanted the compensation for whatever you did back more than anything. I:\tOkay. Yeah. R:\tThats actually what they told me. [Laugh]. Because I had gone for, I believe, ten weeks straight. And so I thought I was doing pretty good. But financially I think I only had one job at a time. And so they told me that the condition was that you pay. And I was likeIm almost done with the classes, at least. And theyre like we dont care; you need [inaudible 70:16] or youre going to go right back. I:\tReally? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd so what happened then? R:\tMy mom let me borrow $700. I:\tWow. So it wasnt even a small amount. Its not like you can just go to your sofa cushion and pull some change out. This was serious money. R:\tWell, the full [haul? 70:39] was, I think, $2100. And so I had paid it week to week, along [inaudible 70:45]. You know, as I got my paycheck Id throw some at the pretrial thing, and then Id keep going. But I was pretty  I dont know; I guess more in disbelief of the justice system about things. You know, I figuredhey, you go to anger management and become a better person, [Laugh] And, you know, youll pay us back when you can. But no, it was a hurry up and pay it, or you go back to jail. I:\tIm sorry; so the total you had to pay was $700 to take the anger management class? R:\tNo. Well, there was an anger management class, and then there was a restitution fee. And then  I think whatever, the county fees or whatever for things that they have there. I:\tSo at the very end Im going to ask you a set of questions about the different kinds of fines and fees that you were left with after participatingso well get into some details about that. And it shouldnt be too long from now, either.  Were you changed in any way, [name], by being detained in jail? R:\tMore disillusioned in the justice system. I:\tYeah. R:\tYeah. You see movies on TV and you expect some justice in real forms. But  I mean, Im sure there were crazy people in there with us, you know? But the majority of them were pretty small infractions, and their whole lives are ruined. Their wives are going to kick them out, and so on and so forth.  I:\tSo give me a sense Because even more you had experienced jail it sounds like you had a number of negative experiences with the criminal justice system. Mostly [inaudible] because of your interactions with the cops, right? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo what was it that you learned in the context of jail that went above and beyond what you learned on the street, hanging out and getting stopped, and that kind of thing? R:\tUmm  its vastly different. I:\tDo you see what I mean? It sounds like you had already become disillusioned because of your interactions. So Im wondering how jail might have made it worse. R:\tIts [inaudible 72:59] I believed criminals are mostly locked up. But then I started dealing with day-to-day things of just being out. So I would just be arrested for walking, or be arrested for looking brown or things like that. I:\tYeah. R:\tSo after jail and everything, its just all of it is fucked up in my head. I:\tRight. Did anything good come out of detention? R:\tGetting out. [Laugh] I:\t[Laugh] You want to tell me about that first moment, that first day that you were out after spending those days in jail? R:\tI had pocket money; just enough for a bus. I think. So I took a bus back home. Got my car, when to my [inaudible 73:45] and went to go get something to eat [inaudible 73:49]. I:\tDid you go to see your family? R:\tUmm  [inaudible 73:53] because my family is very judgmental, especially about getting [inaudible 73:57]. No matter what happens, its my fault. I:\tRight. And when you had this experience when you were in jail for a few days did you have counsel?  R:\tNo. not even once. I:\tSo you never saw a public defender or anything like that? R:\tEven up to court I never saw him. I met him on the outside, right before the court. And whatever he was going to say I dont even think I knew entirely. [Inaudible 74:27] I was just another person.  I:\tSo when they told you about this option to do pretrial diversion, did they tell you much about pretrial diversion? Did they tell you what their expectations were? How much information were you given about that whole process? R:\tUmm, none. I:\tSo it was you can do this or you can go back to that cell, or something Im imagining. R:\tYep. And I kissed the judges ass for telling [inaudible 74:58] pretty much.  I:\tOkay. And so what factors affected your decision to actually participate in the diversion program, then? R:\tI really didnt want to go back to jail. I:\tAnd was that the only thing? R:\tYeah. I was looking at a felony count, and so that would have been, I dont knowwhat, two months? A month in jail? I couldnt [inaudible 75:27]. I:\tYeah. R:\tAnd so the program wasnt bad. Even if I went to jail Im pretty sure I would have got stuck with the restitution fee, anyways. So it was really just ten weeks  or, no; twelve weeks? Ten weeks? I forgot. Of anger management classes. They were an hour long. It wasnt the worst inconvenience. I mean, it was time-consuming. I couldnt wait to finish it. But it [inaudible 75:27] worse. Because then right after that Id go home and my girlfriend would pick me up and wed go out to eat. Right? I:\tRight. All things considered, much better than spending more time in jail. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat were told is that when people are given the opportunity to do pretrialsome pretrial diversion programtheyre interviewed in order to be able to kind of find out what kinds of needs somebody might have, or what levels of risk they have. Do you remember getting an interview like this? R:\tYeah. I went [inaudible 76:21] I:\tNot at all? Okay. How much did you think that the program would help you in any way? Not at all? Some? Quite a bit? A lot? R:\tA little bit. Everyone jokingly  I know Im kind of angry guy. So anger management I thought would be kind of cool. But it was really just community discussion. I:\tOkay. So it was essentially getting together in a group and talking about what [inaudible 77:12]. R:\tYeah. It was mostly [inaudible 77:15] once a week. Like how those individual experiences went. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And Im assuming when you went to the anger management classes they asked you to pay some amount per week? R:\tIts already added into the court fees. Its all paid together. I:\tOkay. And the total sum seems like it was a lot. Did they waive or reduce this amount for you at all? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd what were the conditions of your participation in the anger management class? R:\tYou just had to talk once. It was pretty much everyone just took a turn talking. When that was done, then you were done. I:\tWas there any question about how many classes you could miss, or that kind of thing? R:\tYou could only miss  you could miss them, if you called ahead. You could only miss two without telling them, and then everything just reverted back to straight jail. I:\tWhat would you say that the program did to address your needs? R:\tUmm, nothing. Nothing that I can think of. I:\tAnd during this period did you have any other kinds of supervision? R:\tUmm  there was aI think she was the organizer of the whole thing [inaudible 78:52] charge. The guy below her, and then a cop standing around. I:\tBut not very much. People were present, but you didnt  you didnt feel like you were being supervised-supervised. R:\tNo. Yeah, it didnt feel at all [inaudible 79:10]. It was literally just tell everyone about your week and what you did to not stay angry. Just have a [inaudible 79:18]. The ironic part is that sitting there made me angry. Because [inaudible 79:20] everyone. [Laugh] I:\t[Laugh] Right. That was actually the next question I was going to ask youif you felt like there were any negative consequences or experiences associated with your participation. R:\tIt felt more like school than anything. An understaffed teacher having to teach 36 kids at once. So they were big classes. And they even got bigger as they went. So we were stuck there even longer. But it really was just one person and thats all they had. I:\tWhen you were there did you become friends with or become acquaintances with any of the other program participants? R:\tNo. I:\tCould you tell me about any of the staff from the program that you interacted with the most? R:\tNo. Not that [inaudible 80:08]. I:\tSo no real relationships came out of this situation. R:\tNo. I never talked to anyone again. Never talked to anyone outside of the place, either.  I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tYeah, I cant sit still for too long. I:\tSo even the hour was kind of difficult. R:\tToo much. I:\tWere you ever violated for like non-compliance or anything like that? R:\tNo. I dont think so. Thats never happened [inaudible 80:41]. There was just the one time I [inaudible 80:47]. I:\tSo after the last [inaudible 80:55] class did anything happen?  R:\tAfter the last class? I:\tHow do you know the class was successfully done? You believe you successfully completed the program. R:\tWhat do you do on the last day? I:\tYeah. And in general, how do you know that you successfully completed the program? You just take the classes and then you dont have to show up again? R:\tThey [inaudible 81:16]. The last day you just go. [Inaudible 81:19] they just say that its going to go back to the judge and then from there you have to go to court again, and then tell the judge that you finished the class. And thats when he told me about the restitution thing [inaudible 81:33]. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. And so to what extent would you say that the program overall was helpful to you? R:\tI guess very. It kept me out of jail. I:\tBut nothing specific about what you learned in the context of the class that you found terribly helpful? R:\tYeah. I dont think it achieved its purpose. But I would do it again over my two options. [Laugh] I:\tYeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. Would you recommend the program at all to others?  R:\tAs a way of not going to jail, yeah. I:\tBut not in terms of actually learning anything thats going to help you with regard to anger. R:\t[Inaudible 82:34] thinking that yeah, it would help you out at all. I at least thought I would pick up somethingsome method or something. They never talked about  they would just talk about the individual actions of what happened. Like, more just patting people on the back for when they did good. I:\tSo what do you think they could do, [name], to improve the program? R:\tLike I mentioned, it felt very understaffed. So I mean, just  its one thing to actually have someone there to help youlike a counselor. Which they did. But the one counselor for everyone doesnt help.  I:\tRight. So better staffing, so that they have enough people to deal with the mountains of folks who were coming in and out of the classes. R:\tYeah. Because some of the people in there, their stories were pretty bad.  I:\tRight. R:\tAnd they really needed help. Im assuming they probably thought that this would really help them out with their [inaudible 83:31] problems, you know? But like I said, it was just a [inaudible 83:36]. I:\tI promise you this is the last question on this issue at least. Did you feel like the programthe anger management classprepared you in any way to deal with the challenges that you might have after program participation? R:\tIf I dont want to sit through this boring class again dont do anything.  I:\tOkay. R:\tYou have to go back twice before [inaudible 84:02]. But I dont even know if thats [inaudible 84:05]. I:\tSo your first month out of jailis there anything more that youd like to tell me about your experiences immediately after your release from jail? R:\tIt was a bit of a struggle to [catch?] my mental health [again? 84:29]. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. So was that part of this [inaudible 84:32] adjustment afterwards? R:\tYeah. I:\tCan you tell me a little bit more about that, [name]? R:\t[Unintelligible  84:52]. It was always difficult to [inaudible 84:51] I guess, or do anything. I didnt really want to go out. I still dont really want to go out. The [inaudible 85:00] situations [inaudible].  I:\tRight. Right. I feel like were talking about some really important things that I want to be able to hearand hear well. But I think because of the  it sounds like youre driving now and Im having a hard time hearing you clearly. Is it possible for us to either end the call until youve stopped driving, so that we can finish up this part of the conversation? R:\t[Unintelligible 85:33] [End of audio 85:44] End SF218, part one    SF218, part 1\t\tPage 1   \n",
      "\t I:\t[Name]? R:\tIt sounds like our call dropped. I:\tYeah, it did. I have to admit it sounds a lot clearer now, so I cant be mad at it. I just have a few sets of questions left, and then I can let you go. R:\tSure. I:\tSo you were describing your toughest adjustment after being released was dealing with your anxiety again. R:\tYeah. I:\tI didnt catch the last part of what you said. Would you mind sharing that with me again? R:\tOh, sure. Well, it was really difficult after everything. I had [inaudible 0:45] work, so I had to go back to my psychiatrist again because my whole stay had messed me up. That was interesting. Really shaky for a while. Really jumpy and nervous. I:\tHow long would you say this went on? R:\tFor like two months. I:\tAnd during that period Im assuming that before you went to jail you had a job. And then you lost the job. So once you got out Im imagining that you didnt have a job then. Is that the case? R:\tYeah. But it only took me like a week to get another job. I:\tSo thats not so bad. R:\tYeah. I mean, I still had to work.  I:\tYeah. And having spent time in jail, did that make working difficult? R:\tUmm  no. It was good to have a distraction. It was more of my personal and social life [inaudible 1:48]. I just really didnt do anything [inaudible 1:50] fun or [inaudible].  I:\tIt sounds to me, [name], like you were depressed. R:\tYeah. [Inaudible 1:59].  I:\tSo after you were released did you have any Im wondering about whatever access to programs and services you might have had. Did you have any [inaudible 2:19]? Some of these I think I probably can answer for you. Im assuming they didnt do [inaudible 2:24] access to help finding [inaudible]. R:\tThrough my health insurance I was able to get help. But nothing else that I had available to me or   I:\tBesides the health care needs was there anything else that you [inaudible 2:45] that you didnt have access to? R:\tUmm  no. Not really. Theres nothing else I needed. It was more me. It just took me awhile to get out of that funk. And then paying back the money obviously wasnt easy, so  [laugh] I:\tRight.  R:\tIt was a lot taken out of that and for everything. And so it was just  it was a lot of problems. I:\tThe job that you got after you got out, what job was that one? R:\tIt was back to janitorial. I:\tOkay. And how did you find that job? R:\tMy dad owns a company. He  I would work for him [inaudible 3:31].  I:\tAnd how much were you paid, hourly, for that job? R:\tI think like $12 or $13. I:\tAnd during that period of time what types of support [inaudible 3:48]? Did they give you any help with money, housing, [inaudible 3:52] support? [Inaudible 3:53]? Definitely finding a job. R:\tYeah. Jobs, and I lived with him. So I got that. But my dad is not a very emotional person. I:\tSo not any of that. It sounds like once you were released you didnt really have much contact with too many friends, at least for [inaudible 4:20]. R:\tYeah. I really didnt want to talk to anyone or do anything.  I:\tSo it really had a negative effect on some of your relationships for a little while. R:\tOh, yeah. For sure. I:\tYour friends, during this period of timewere they any kind of support for you, after you had been released? Financial, housing, emotional? R:\tNo. Just company. Im really good at keeping things to myself. So I mean, I would see my friends still. And Id just pretend everything is okay. I:\tRight. R:\tI mean, Im sure I was a lot different [inaudible 5:02]. I:\tYep. R:\tYeah, [inaudible 5:05] everythings fine. I:\tRight. Holding it all in. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd during this whole period of time [inaudible 5:18] situation was prettywas your housing situation pretty stable during this period of time? R:\tSort of. I guess my housingI did have a stable place to live, but I lived with my dad. And hes kind of a mess, too. So it kind of messes with me. [Laugh] Me and him dont get along very well. I:\tRight. Does that mean that you were sometimes staying with other people? R:\tYeah. I would prefer to be anywhere but home, for the most part. I:\tOkay. So one of the next questions I have is about the pros and cons of your living situation. And from what I hear, you are saying that the pros are that you had a place to stay. But the cons are that you were staying with your dad and you didnt have a good relationship with him. R:\tYes. I:\tIs there anything else that you would add to that? R:\tNo. Mostly [inaudible 6:19]. I:\tAnd your living situation now, you are with your partner and its the two of you and your son? R:\tIts me and my partner, her mother, and my son. Yeah. But we have a house, so its cool. I:\tAnd what would you describe as the pros and cons of your living situation now? R:\tUmm  cons; the worst of it is I have to take her mom to work at this time. Like, literally right nowthats what Im doing; I took her mom to work. So its more of just an inconvenience than anything. But we get along very well. She helps me out a lot with my son. She [inaudible 7:03]. So everything else [inaudible] great. Im actually [inaudible 7:06] here. I:\tOkay, good. Im really glad to hear that. Since your release have you had any trouble finding a place to live because of contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tNo. Everything was always off my record, at least. Fortunately. I:\tYeah. R:\tSo [inaudible 7:23] anything. I:\tAnd in terms of your neighborhood, here is a set of questions. Im going to list off some statements, and I want you to tell me whether you  strongly disagree to strongly agree. In my first month out I felt like my neighborhood was a safe place to live. So you strongly agree, strongly disagree, somewhere in-between? [Technical issues.]  R:\tSomewhere in-between I:\tIn my first month out it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tUmm  strongly disagree. It was pretty easy to not do anything. I:\tAnd were you ever nervous about seeing  Okay, so I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tYeah. I:\tAgree? Strongly agree? R:\tJust agree. I:\tAnd drug selling is a problem, a major problem? R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tI strongly disagree. I:\tI cared what my neighbors think about me or my actions. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who live there could get together to resolve it. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tI expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tOkay. So now I want to think about the neighborhood where you currently live. Is that a safe neighborhood? My neighborhood is a safe place to live. R:\tSorry, I think I got them confused. I thought we were talking about my current neighborhood. I:\tOkay, Im going to put down the answers that you have me to that one, and then we can move to your  the first set of questions was about basically your fathers place. R:\tOh. I:\tBecause thats where you lived when you first got out, right? R:\tYeah. Its pretty much the exact opposite of all those answers. [Laugh] I:\tOkay. So his neighborhood is a safe neighborhood, then. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd it is still not hard to stay out of troublebecause you just stayed away from people. R:\tYeah. Its [inaudible 10:03]. I:\tWere you nervous about seeing anyone in his neighborhood? R:\tUmm  I would still say yeah. I:\tOkay. And the drug selling was a major problem in his neighborhood? Im assuming strongly disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd then all the other things about how good the neighborhood is you would agree with. Okay. R:\tYeah. I:\tIm glad that we got that cleared up. Okay. So in terms of your housing situation, what are your future goals? R:\tI would want to get a second house. Remodel the place Im at into a business.  I:\tAnd is that where youre going to keep as a home baseyour animal care? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. And is there anything else youd like to add about the housing situation after you left jail? R:\tAfter I left jail? No. Everything was  I mean, just drama with my dad. But I had a place to live. Its not like I was worried about walking around at night or anything like that. I:\tWhen did the job with your dad end? How long were you working with him? R:\tI was always on and off. I havent recently. I havent worked for him since  probably like three years ago. I:\tAnd the reason it neededdid you quit and take another job somewhere else? R:\tSort of. Yeah. I:\tDid you ever have any period during this time when you were without a job? R:\tRight now, sort of. I:\tBut now you are self-employed. So would you consider that to be unemployed? R:\tNo. I figure it could be better. But thats probably [inaudible 12:34]. I:\tIm still here. Im just skipping ahead through some questions. Okay. So now were at the final set, where Im going to ask you some questions about the financial obligations you incurred because of criminal justice contact. You mentioned that [inaudible 13:24] deal with. One was restitution, right? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAnd what was the total amount associated with restitution? R:\tIn total I think everything was $2100. I:\tSo in total. Is it possible for you separate it out? Or do you just remember the larger amount? R:\tI just remember the big fee. Because it was all connected to pretrial. I:\tOkay. R:\tIt was like [inaudible 13:49] there to the actual pretrial department. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd its all collected together. I think they had a breakdown, if you needed it. But I dont remember caring that much. I:\tOkay. This is very helpful. A lot of people dont know what the answer to that question is. So Im appreciative. Have you experienced any of the following because of your criminal justice debt? Have you been asked to go back to court? R:\tFor pretrial? No. I:\tHave you been reincarcerated specifically because of criminal justice debt? R:\tNo. Just the threat of it. I:\tSo they basically say if you dont pay us back in a timely manner were going to  were going to revoke your freedom and put you back in jail? R:\tOh, yeah. Its revoke your freedom, and then hit you with a felony. [Inaudible 14:40] not just like you work towards anything. No, its you do it or were going to charge you with what we were going to charge you with. And knowing the government, Im sure they keep the money anyway. [Laugh].  I:\tSo any violations associated with the criminal justice debt? R:\tSame thing. No, but threatened with it. I think until I finish the program if I incurred anything I would automatically become a felon and get the time for that. [Inaudible 15:12] but what happened during pretrial was. So like, if I did anything to break the law and I got arrested againI would be [inaudible 15:19] felony. I:\tAnd all the fees would just continue to pile on, Im sure. R:\tYeah. I:\tIm assuming that you didnt get your drivers license revoked. R:\tNo. I:\tAny wages garnished? R:\tThey attempted to. Or, they wanted to. But I paid everything like on a schedule with it. So they never bothered. I:\tOkay. So it sounds like you didnt actually experience anything negative, but there were lots of threats about it. R:\tOh, yeah. [Inaudible 15:58] pretty much anytime I talked to somebody they would always threatened you for the money, or ask for it, or  there was always the dont become a felon again. That was the [inaudible 16:07] one. I:\tRight. Did these fines and feeshow would you say that they have affected your life? R:\tUmm  at that time, pretty harshly. But now, in the bigger picture, $2100 isnt that bad.  I:\tWell, tell me about what it did during that time when you had to deal with paying it off.  R:\tOh, that was bad all around. Because I had gotten fired right off the bat. And so I had to work with my dad a lot. And theres a lot of work. And because I had a place to live at leastso it wasnt as big of a problemI could just throw my whole paycheck. I was just throwing my paycheck away for like two, three months. Might as well just throw it out in the window. Same thing. I:\tAnd how long would you say it took before you felt like you were starting to feel some freedom from that obligation? R:\tNot until I was done. Because at first I was excited about the last few days of not having to go back to the actual program. I was paying [inaudible 17:12] week by week. Its not like I wasnt paying. I had to, you know, every two weeks Id drop in a couple hundred bucks. And that was that. But the judge straight up told me thats not enough. We dont give a shit about pretrial. You have to finish it, or youre going back to jail. I:\tWow. Yeah. Okay, so that was the last substantive question that I have for you. Is there anything else that is important to you, or that is going on in your life right now that youd like to talk about? R:\tNo. I mean, everything is pretty [inaudible 17:48]. My life is a lot more playing now, as a [inaudible 18:00]. I have a two year-old. The worst I get  I mean, I still get harassed by police. But now its just tickets, you know? You can [inaudible 18:11] for a ticket. [Laugh]  I:\tAnd because you dont really show up in their system, even if they stop you  Im assuming nothing comes up for them when they run your name. R:\tNo. Everything is always clean. I:\tI ask that because Ive spoken to other people who  you know, whenever they get stopped after having the experience theyre really concerned that somethingthat theyre going to find something to hold them on. And so that whole process scares them a lot. Just getting stoppedor even looked atby a cop really scares them. R:\tWhen they run your name you think  Beas use everything started because the DA wanted to drop an excessive lawsuit from my end for the concussion, and the excessive police brutality part of it. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd so they actually told me that the case was dropped. The DA actually really fucked me over on that. He told me it was dropped and that nothing was going to happen because I had gotten my head crackedliterallyby an officer, and then scratched from Like, I was missing chunks of my face. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd so dropped it, and just I went about my life. And then one random ass-day I got pulled over for a traffic stop and they brought that up. And they were likeno, the DA really wants you in court. Usually they can let it go for a misdemeanor infraction like that. But they were likeno, they really want you in there; he wants you to [inaudible 19:37]. There is no working around it.  And so the cop was actually pretty friendly about it. It wasnt like a violent, terrible exchange for me to go to jail. But you know, then from there onthen I realized that he brought it back up. My face cleared up. He knew that hed fucking get the [win? 19:51] like that.  I:\tRight. You couldnt be in front of the judge and get sympathy because the scars were on your face and theres no evidence of it. Wow. R:\tOn top of that, when I actually went with the judgethe judge said give him pretrial. And the DA was still trying to argue, to fucking make me a felon. I:\tRight. So this is retribution. R:\tYep. I:\tYeah. Im sorry to hear that any of that happened to you, [name]. So those were my last set of questions. Do you have any questions that youd like to ask me? R:\tUmm  if I could be on an email list of some sort, to find out what happens with everything? [Laugh]. I:\tOkay. Give me your email address. Ive been meaning to ask you for that. R:\t[Gives email address.] [Talk about email.]  I:\tThis has been really very illuminating. Ive just enjoyed chatting with you, tooeven if its about this topic. And I appreciate that you would share with me so much. R:\tOkay, sure. No problem. [Inaudible 21:23], right?  I:\tSo take care. And I will be in touch. R:\tOkay. Have a nice day. I:\tOkay you too. Take care. [End of audio 21:35] End SF219, part 2    SF218, part 2\t\tPage 1   \n",
      " I:\tSo I'm going to ask you several sets of questions that have to do with your background, your relationships, and your experience before, during, and after criminal justice contact.

Just took random classes. I mean, I'm going to go back to school, I think, too. I:\tYeah? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIs that something that you have plans in the futureyou're planning on going? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWe'll probably get to some more questions about your goals for stuff like that. If we get a chance, we'll come back to that. Did you ever receive any help in school with academics? So stuff like tutoring, extra reading help, extra math help  R:\tNo. I:\tHow do you support yourself financially? So no support, job or jobs, support from family, support from friends  R:\tJobs. I:\tDo you have more than one job right now? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you usually have more than one job, or is that something that's  R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. Yeah, usually, I have four or five jobsrandom jobs. Yeah. I:\tWhat kinds of jobs do you do, usually? R:\tSo right now, I'm working at a car shop; and, also, I'm working at snack place, where we make all these snacks for companies; and then, also, I'm doing a cleaning job; and then, also, a moving gig. And what else? There's some other job I just got hired for; I forget, because I'm not really that serious about that one. Yeah, just random jobsI have a steady job and a steady income for something elsea personal business. And then I do side jobs, as well. I:\t[3:12 unintelligible]. R:\tOh, shit. I work with a company that my friend hasa record company. Yeah, so it's a steady income. I:\tWe'll come back to more questions about your work, [NAME]. When I'm writing down little notes, it's just so I can remember [3:30 unintelligible]. Any government programs for financial support, nothing like that? R:\tNo. I:\tIllegal income of any kind? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tSo how much money do you earn? That could be by day, by week, every two weekswhatever makes senseor by month or something. R:\tYeah, I mean, I've never even thought about this$3,000 a month [4:03 unintelligible] all combined, yeaha little more or a little less. I:\tSo then what would you say your total household income is? And you can look at this graph here to kind of guess or estimate what you think the  R:\tI'd say maybe the $20,000 to $30,000the second one. Yeahbecause it's after all the bills and stuff, you know. There's nothing. I:\tSo now I'm going to read you some statements that describe how you might feel about your current relationships with your familyand family, in this instanceI'm talking about blood or legal relatives, any significant others or guardians that you've lived with. R:\tOkay. I:\tSo respond to the statements, and then your answer options are: strongly agree; agree; neutral; disagree; strongly disagree; or not applicable. R:\tOkay, okay. I:\tI feel close to my family.\" R:\tAgree. I:\t\"I want my family to be involved in my life.\" R:\tAgree. I:\t\"I consider myself a source of support for my family.\" R:\tNo, strongly disagree. I:\tIs there any reason why it's a strongly? R:\tNo, I just don't really talk to my familyhaven't since I was 15. I'm 36 now. I:\tOh, really? R:\tYeah. I:\tWas there circumstances where you ... R:\tYeah, I just left and never made contact again. Yeah. I:\tWere you leaving a bad situation, or was it ... R:\tNo. I:\tYou just wanted to be out of the house? R:\tYeah, yeah. I wasn't really close to themeither side. I:\tDid you have a plan when you left, when you were 15? Were you working? R:\tNo. Oh, I did start working when I was 16. I:\tYou were working when you were 16, you said? R:\tYeah. I:\tWere you living with friends, or were you ... R:\tFriends, yeah. I:\tThank you for sharing. That stuff might come up again as we go through. So another statement: \"My family is a source of support for me.\" R:\tNo; maybe emotional, but not financial. I:\tOkay. So agree to an extent, or ... R:\tYeah, somewhat agree, yes. I:\t\"I fight a lot with my family members.\" R:\tNo, not at all. I:\tSo strongly disagree? R:\tStrongly disagree, yeah. I:\t\"I often feel like I disappoint my family.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\t\"I'm criticized a lot by my family.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I haven't worried about my family for 25 years. I:\tBut you can still [6:33 unintelligible] some emotional support? R:\tYeah, for sure. Yeah. I:\tSo then I've got some more statements and answers are the same. R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\t\"I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.\" R:\tI guess strongly agree. I:\tAnd how many people would you say? R:\tSeven. I:\tI have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many people would you say ... R:\tMaybe five. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many people would you say ... R:\tMaybe three [7:19 unintelligible]. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many for that one? R:\tFive. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tIs there a reason why you strongly disagree? R:\tNo, no. I:\tWould they not be able to help, or would it be ... R:\tI mean, I don't know. I guess I'd disagree, then. Never asked; I don't know. I:\tI mean, whatever you feel like, you know, whatever your gut, you know, reaction is is fine. So I guess no one would be ... R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed.\" R:\tDisagree. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support.\" You mentioned that ... R:\tDisagree, yeah. I'm sure there is, but I'm just too proud or something, I guess. I'd never have to ask. I:\tSo even if you needed it, you wouldn't turn to family in that instance? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that maybe aren't in our best interests, or they could be sources of stress for us. So if you can think of two kinds of relationships you have with family and friends that are both the good, supportive kinds and also maybe the more destructive or stressful kinds, and share those, and describe what those relationships are like. R:\tI guess my dad's sidethey're really supportive, you know. It's all about school, and learning, and finance, and money. And I guess on my mom's side, it's kind of more just laidback, and have the family and stuff. That's about it. I don't know. I mean, yeah, they're both kind of good. Neither side's destructive. And for friendsyeah, I have a lot of supportive friends, you know. I:\tSo you don't feel like you have any stressful or destructive family and friend relationships or anything? R:\tI have a boyfriend right now that's kind of stressful and destructive, yeah. I:\tIn what ways? What's going on with that? R:\tHe just has weird, violent outbursts. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him. Since I met himhe used to hit me, and thenyeah, he stopped doing that, but now he's really just emotionallyhe's just fucking extra baggage. He's a liability, yeah. I don't know. I:\tHow long have you been with him? R:\tThree years. Yeah, so that's stressful. [10:03 He's a bum]. I:\tThanks for sharing that. R:\tThat's the only stressful one right now. I:\tIt's only stressful right now, you said? R:\tYeah, that's the only stressful situation right now. I:\tDo you have people that you talk to about when those kinds of issues are coming up? R:\tNot really. My therapist, you know, yeah. That's about it. I:\tSomething about that might come up again later on, as we go through, and whatever you feel comfortable sharing. So the next set of questions is about your relationships that go outside your familyso friends. So if you can think of up to three people who you feel the closes toSo your closest friends, not including your romantic partner or ... R:\tNot including, yeah, and not in my family. I:\tYeah. So how many friendsup to threewould you say you feel closest to? R:\t[11:00 crosstalk] Three. I:\tSo then, for the first one that you're thinking ofis that person male, or female ... R:\tFemale. I:\tHow would you describe her race or ethnicity? R:\tShe is white. I:\tAnd how old is she? R:\t35. I:\tDo you know the highest level of education she's completed? R:\tI think she went to college.

R:\tI think he receives SSI. I:\tIs he married or living with a partner? R:\tYeah, a partner. I:\tSo then for your third friend that you're thinking ofis that person male, or female, or another gender? R:\tMale or theyneither. I:\tOther? R:\tYeah, other.

I:\tAnd then are they married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tSo now I'm going to ask you some questions about groups and organizations that you might be a part of, and if you receive any emotional or any material support from them. So just like when we're talking about family, emotional support means someone to turn to, to talk about personal problems and that kind of thing. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd then material supportfinancial support, [13:44 unintelligible] jobs, help finding a place to live, that kind of thing. R:\tOkay. I:\tSo do you belong to any kind of church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organizations? R:\tNot religious, but I kind of go to AA. And then, also, I volunteer at this place called Food Not Bombs. I:\tSo how often do you go to AAweekly, monthly, daily? R:\tOnce a month. I:\tCan you turn to them for emotional support? R:\tEmotional, yeah. I:\tHow about material support? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd with Food Not Bombs, how often do you go to meetings or ... R:\tI used to volunteer every Thursday, and I've kind of laxed off because I've been working a lot. So not very often now. I:\tSo once a month now, or ... R:\tYeah, probably once a month or so. I:\tWould you be able to turn to people there for emotional support? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow about material support? R:\tI'm sure. I:\tDo you belong to any kind of recreational club?

You can just go in and do your own thing. I:\tHow often do you go? R:\tI was supposed to go today. I stopped going for a whilea yearand then I was starting to pick it back up again, because I haven't been really doing that for a minute. I:\tHow often do you usually do it when you are kind of in it? R:\tThey're every day, almost, or every other day. But yeah, I used to live around the corner from it, and now I live over here. So that's why I haven't made it out, you know, because it's in the city. So yeah, I hardly ever go to the city anymore. I:\tYearly now, or monthly, or ... R:\tGod, I want to go monthly. I'd say monthly, yeah. I:\tWould you be able to turn to that group for emotional support? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow about material support? R:\tNo. I:\tAny sort of crew or gang? R:\tHmm [no?]. I:\tAny sort of local government group or anything like that? R:\tHmm-mm [no]. I:\tCivic association? R:\tHmm-mm [no]. I:\tSo now I'm going to ask you some questions about your employment history. So how old were you when you had your first job? R:\tI was 16. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life have you been employed? So all of it, most of it, some of it ... R:\tMost of it.

I:\tHave you ever done anything that felt like a career to you, like something you would want to do for a long period of time? R:\tI would say the tattooing, yeah. That was fun, yeah. I:\tIs there a reason why you don't do it anymore? R:\tWell, yeah, there is. Yeah. It just got to be really boring after a while. I mean, I had a lot of clientele and different people, but sometimes the stupid shit you'd have to tattoo on people is annoying, and boring, and stupid. So it just became really a boring job to me, even though I was doing art, and it was really fun, and people were very excited, and they're like, oh, I love it; oh, this is great. But after a while, it just kind of seemed like work and just really mundane. And I just wasn't into it anymore. I:\tWhen you're thinking about the jobs you have and work that you're doing, are you looking for stuff that doesn't feel like work? You mentioned it started to feel like work and not as fun. R:\tYeah. Not right now. But yeah, in the future, I'm going to go back to school, and see what I want to do, you knowsee what I might be into that's not going to be where I have to go to school for 10 years, 15; then I'm unqualified because I'm a 50-year-old woman now, you know. So someone with the education that's just turned 25, you knowprobably someone would want to hire someone like that than someone older, you know. Something that I'd be into that's not too much schoolrevolved around having to go to school for a long, long time. Just want to check out a couple of things, you know. I:\tDo you have ideas of stuff that you're potentially interested in? R:\tMaybe some kind of outreach work, yeah. I:\tSocial work? R:\tYeah, yeah. Something where I help people, even if it's old people ornot really teaching, but, you know, something where I help the community, help people, you know, stuff like that. I like to work with people. I:\tYeah? R:\tYeah. I:\tThanks for sharing that. We might have some more questions come up. R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tCan you tell me about your most positive work experience, and what made it positive? R:\tI was a bike messenger, and that was just really fun, because I was outside all day, riding my bike. And it was like playing a video game, and it was just super fun. That was the best job I ever hador the funnest job, because, yeah, I'd just go and deliver things, just riding around the city, and just hanging out outside all day. It was just super fun. That was a great job. That's my job that I liked the most I've ever had. I:\tReally? R:\tUh-huh [yes]. I:\tWere you earning okay money at it? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tCould you tell me about your most negative work experience, and what made that so negative? R:\tOh God, I worked at a bar recently, right before this job. [25:42 unintelligible] sucked. I:\tYeah? What sucked about it? R:\tOh, just the people, really, because it was just a bunch of hipsters and just weird-ass people that all lived together, and partied together, and worked together. So they were just all fucking bro jock mentality and gross as fuckjust fake as fuck, and just really dumb. And then the person that they all were like, ohthe boss that everyone kissed their ass, and they were just so stupid, just dumb, and they would just take their mood out on everybody, and made people feel like pieces of shit because they have a horrible life. Yeah. So that was the worst job I've had, ever. I:\tSo negative coworkers [26:30 crosstalk]. R:\tYeah, yeah. There were some cool people that worked there, but mainly, they were just dumb hipsters that just would get off of work, and just hang out at the bar, and just stay there all day. They had no life, you know. It was really gross. Yeah, because they're just their little clique of dumb people, and they all live in the same two houses, and work, and all party together. And they were just dumb people in general, so it made it worse. So yeah, that was recent. That's the worst job [27:03 unintelligible 00:27:03] ever. They hire all these people, and they never keep them. I know a lot of people that's worked at this bar, and they always can them after about two to three months, so they can't become employees, so they can't receive benefits. Yeah, so this place, I guess that's their thing. They've been doing this for years. So yeah, from what I've heard from a lot of people, they've never worked over three months. So yeah, that's one of the worst ones. Yeah, that was recently. I would come home, and just feel like shit, you know, and I'd hate being at work, where every minute was just gruelingoh, I hate this place, you know. And then people that were in their little clique would actually stay over two to three hours for free, work for freebecause they never paid overtime. They would notwhich is against the law. And then they would just be, oh, I'm just doing it because I love the company. And it's like, no, you're a fucking kiss-ass, and you suck. Yeah. When my shift was over, I was flying out the door, you know, fucking out of here; fuck this place. Yeah. I:\tAnd that was something that you wouldn't have put up withworking overtime, and not getting paid, and that kind of thing? R:\tMm-hmm, mm-hmm [yes]. I:\tThank you for sharing that. Is there anything you'd like to add or talk about more about those kinds of work experiences? R:\tNo. I:\tSo the following questions are about experiences you may have had with substance abuse, if any. So just remember that all your responses are private. If there's anything that you don't want to talk about or makes you feel uncomfortable, just let me know. R:\tOkay. I:\tHave you ever had a drinking or a drug problem? R:\tYeah, I have. I:\tDrugs, alcohol, both? R:\tAll. I:\tAnd how old were you when both or either problem began? R:\tMaybe when I was 17. I really got into heroin, yeah. I ruined my life. I:\tYeah? R:\tYeah. Well, yeah. I've done some pretty gnarly things I probably wouldn't have if I was never exposed to that kind of life, you know. I:\t[29:02 unintelligible]. R:\tYou know, just the way I would make money, or, you know, just selling drugsjust because I was doing drugs and around that lifestyle, you know. So yeah. I:\tHave you ever received treatment for drinking and drug problems? R:\tActually, with this whole thing is where I received treatment one time, yeah. I:\tThroughout pretrial ... R:\tYeah, I think so. What exactly is pretrial diversion? Is it a ... I:\tYou can do it in a bunch of different programs or a bunch of different ways. Some people will assigned community service, or classes, or drug treatment, or something like that. And then a lot of times, if you complete whatever treatment plan or whatever plan they have you do, then the charges are dismissed. R:\tOh, I think I did this for anger management recently. I think that's probably how you guys got my number or something. I:\tWere you doing anger management through a pretrial office? Did they ... R:\tI don't know. I:\tDid you have a case worker at the San Francisco pretrial office? R:\tI think so. Yeah. I think so. I can't even remember. I:\tWas the anger management court-ordered? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tAnd then did you have charges dismissed after you completed it? R:\tI think so. Yeah, so that's probably [30:08 crosstalk]. Yeah, okay. I:\tSo how many times have you ever received treatment for drugs? Have you ever gone to a drug treatment ... R:\tOnce, yeah. I:\tAnd then for alcohol treatment? Have you ever been treated for alcohol problems? R:\tI went to a detox to detox myself, and then I would go to an AA here and there. I:\tSo once forI would count the detox as a treatment, even if you checked yourself into it [30:35 crosstalk]. R:\tIt's three days, you know. I:\tSo then two times total, including a drug [30:42 crosstalk]. R:\tOkay, yeah. I:\tYou just said kind of offhand that drug use ruined your life. And so the question is how you would describe the effects that alcohol and drug use have had on your life. I mean, so if you wouldn't mind going a little bit more into depth. And that can be stuff about employment, education, goals, relationshipshow is ... R:\tYeah, it just made me kind of unmotivated, to where I wouldn't pay my rent, you knowpartied until I was homeless. Yeah, just kind of where I'd stop workingfind other means to make money, different schemes, and grifts, and, you knowyeah, other ways to make money, because I'd get fired. I'd never get fired; I just stopped going in, stopped being a functioning person, you know. Yeah. I:\tDid it ever have any effect on personal relationships? R:\tOh yeah. Yeah. People would just leave because they're like, man, they're not doingyou know what I mean? I'd be like, just go; I'm doing this over here, and you're trying to do this, and whatever. Just go, yeah. I think a couple people have moved on because of that, you know. I:\tSo romantic relationships, or friendships, or both? R:\tBoth, yeah, yeah. I:\tDid it ever affect your relationship with family? R:\tNo. I:\tBecause you were on your own by then? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWas drug use or alcohol usewas there any influence there on your decision to leave when you were 15? R:\tNo. Actually not, no. I:\tThat's something that started a little bit after you'd already left your family? R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. I:\tDo you think that not being around your family had any influence on you getting into that? R:\tProbably, yeah. Yeah, because [32:43 unintelligible] the kind of peopleyou know, friends were doing it and stuff. It never was a problem. And then I had a boyfriend that introduced me to heroin, and that waswow. Yeah. If I was in school and stuff, I probably would have just quit going to school. But yeah, it was my dad's side. I moved there when I was 13, and he kicked me out when I was 15. I mean, it was just through the way I dressed, you know. So ... I:\t[33:10 crosstalk]. R:\tYeah, because he just didn't understand it. He didn't understand the kind of rock n rollI listen to rock n roll and shit like that, punk rock, and was not okay or whatever. So they'd hide all my clothes, take everything out of my roomposters, all kinds of stuff. Yeah. So yeah, I guess it was more just because of that only, you know. So yeah, think the teenage angst kind of thing, you know, or whatever. So yeah, yeahbecause I feel like if he didn't care about the music I listened to, and the friends I hung out with, and the kind of clothes I wore, and the hairstyleslike Mohawks oryou know what I mean? I would have completed school.  I would have kept going. I was hitchhiking to school. I made straight As my whole life. I excelled pretty much in everything I've ever done, as far as school, anyway. Academics, I was always overachiever. And yeah, I think if that never happened, I probably would have went to college, probably for the interests I had at the time, you knowbecause I was really into neurology. I really wanted to become a surgeon, because everybody on my dad's side are doctors and nurses. All my cousins, all my fucking aunts and unclesand yeah. So you know, I kind of started getting into neurology and how the brain works, you know. I was just reading for fun like that, you know. So yeah, I think thatI don't even remember what the question was. I went off on a tangent there. I:\tNo, it's great, it's great. We were talking about the effects that drug and alcohol use have had on your life in general, and then we were kind of talking about you leaving home when you were 15. R:\tYeah, yeah. It wasn't because of drugs I left, you know. It was just because of the way I looked and stuff. You know what I mean? But it's like when I left, then I moved to San Francisco from LA. And yeah, just the stuff I seen, you know, and the people I hung out with, got introduced toand I was very young, 15. So I was really open to anything, you know. Then I got this boyfriend that was just all bad, so that introduced all that shit, you knowbecause I was really against heroin and really against everything, you know. I'd make fun of them. There's roommates I had. I'd be like, oh my God, they're doing heroin. What the fuck? And I was really scared of that shit, you know, and then I started doing it, and I wasn't scared anymore of it. So yeah. But yeah, drugs and alcohol didn't influence my leaving home, though, you know. Yeah. That was a lot later. I:\tThank you for sharing [35:42 crosstalk]. Have you ever had any kind of arrests or legal problems that were related to drug or alcohol use? R:\tYeah, sales, yeah. And then I think it's really fucked up what the legal system is like. Possessionit's really weird. If you have just a little stuffit doesn't matter what it isthey can arrest you just for possession, which is kind of stupid, because you're not hurting anybody; you're just hurting yourself. So you can catch a whole fucking criminal law over just having, you know, some kind of pills. Not really weed, I guess, because in California, the weed laws nowbut yeah, just having personal products on you, you know. You can catch a case behind thatbecause I've caught two cases just for having stuff in my pockets, you know. So that was fucked up, you know. One time, it was sales, because I was selling crack and stuff. I think one time, I had some heroin in my pocket, and I caught a case for that. And then one time, I had just some crack in my pocket. I didn't even know it was there, because I was an active user at the time, fucking street grinding, just selling drugs and doing all that shit. Yeah, and they were pulling stuff out of my pockets. It's like, oh, holy shit. And so I got a case for that, yeah. And I had to go to jail because of that. It's like, what the fuck? Yeah, I wasn't doing anything wrong. Yeah, they ran my name because of the way I looked or whatever. They were running a lot of people's names. And so then I got two cases for thatyeah, for them running my name randomly because of the way I looked, yeah. So that was kind of upsetting, yeah.  That happened, I think, really close time to each other. I think that's when they offered me a program or something. And I was in jail for a long time for that. I was in jail for three months for having some drugs for personal use on me. Yeah. I:\tHow long ago was that? R:\tGod, 15 years or something, maybe. Yeah, that was a long time ago. I was 18 or 19. I:\tWe might come back to that [38:07 crosstalk]. R:\tYeah, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I think laws have changed now or something, I'm pretty sure. But I haven't went to jail in fucking decades, so ... I:\tIs that the most recent time that you were in jail15 years ago? R:\tOh, no, no, no. There was the ... I:\tThe pretrial [38:21 crosstalk]. R:\t... anger management thing. Yeah, yeah. I:\tAnd that was more recent, right? R:\tYeah. That was four years ago or something, maybe three. Three or four, yeah. I:\tDo you feel like you have a drinking or drug problem now? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd you mentioned you go to AA. R:\tYeah, here and there. I:\tI mean, how are you able to overcome drug use [38:46 unintelligible]? R:\tI think it's a decision you make. Yeah, where it's like, I don't fucking like this shit. It's not fun anymore. And you kind of look around, and you're like, man, fuck all these people. They're all fake, you know. It's just an illusion, you know. It was like, oh wow, I'm hanging out with the same people every weekend, and drinking, and it's just a dumb illusion. Do these people really care about you? Are they your friends, or just someone like, hey, hi every time you see them? And when I got sober, I would see that. I would still go out, and hang out with everybody, all my friends, and go to shows and stuff. And I would still just see all this fakeness of just coming together over a drink, you know. And I just thought it was really weird. And it became more and more apparent, you know, sometimes, it's all people have in common. Oh, I'm so drunk, and everybody's laughing at them. And it's like, wow, that's really dumb, and it's not really funny, you know. I:\tDo you feel like you get something more genuine out of relationships with people who you're not bonding over drinking, or drugs, or ... R:\tYeah, yeah, I kind of do. And I'm not saying that if that's the only thing you have in common, and that's how you know each other, and that's how you come together, you know, then you kind of get to know each other intimately just through that. But you can still make friends and stuff. And sometimes, it is just an illusion of a fake reality, I think. That's just my opinion. Sometimes, when you have things in commonsay you're just sober, and this other person's soberthat's what you have in common. Other than that, I would never talk to this person, you know. But then you find out things about them. You hang out with them. And, you know, you get to know them as a person, and it's cool, you know. I mean, I have friends that still drink and smoke weed, and I still hang out with them. And, you know, I know them personally. And it's just I don't do that. You know, I just choose not to. But yeah. I:\tHow has your substance abuse issues changed over the years, if at all? R:\tShit. Well, I don't know. I think I've had fits where I'll do something really hardcore, and then I'll just be like, I don't want to do that anymore, and I just stop, you know, because I had a really bad crack problem fucking four or five years ago. And I just stopped. I was like, fuck this shit. Why am I doing this? I'd be selling crack in the middle of the night, and then going inside, sleep all day. You know, it was just really dumb. And then I stopped doing all that, and then I started drinking every day. And then I was sober. And then I just got into heroin again. It was really weird. I don't know. I stop participating in it, you know. I don't know. I:\tIs there anything that you'd like to add or talk about more about this kind of stuff? R:\tNo, I'm okay. I:\tSo I'm going to ask you about your mental and emotional health. And again, all your responses are private. If you don't want to talk about something, just let me know. Have you ever been told by a mental health professional, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, that you had a mental or emotional condition, or that you showed symptoms of a mental or emotional condition? R:\tI think I was told I had a personality disorder. And I don't even know what the fuck that means, yeah. I think it was just a very vague diagnosis, you know. I:\tWhat was the circumstances of that? Who was telling you that? R:\tOne of these doctors. I was trying to apply for SSI, you know. And some of that's, you knowI received it shortly, and it was for that. Even to this day, I don't know what the fuck that meansa personality disorder. I:\tDid they explain it to you, or did they ... R:\tYeah, but I don't even really remember, you know. I:\tDid they [42:36 unintelligible]? Did they try to prescribe you medicine or anything like that? R:\tI just wouldn't take medicine, yeah, because a lot of traumatic stuff happened at certain times. So I think I just had a breakdown, sort of, you know. So yeah. I:\tWhat kinds of stuff was going on? R:\tI lived on the street, and my house burned downthis house that I was payingand so that happened. My mom got murdered by a stalker. I:\tOh my gosh, I'm so sorry. R:\tYeah. So this all happened within a fucking month or two of each other. So my mom got murdered by a stalker. My house burned down. I lost my job. My two cousins got attacked by tigers at the San Francisco fucking Zoo. What else happened at this time? Oh, I fucking found some pills on the fucking ground. And this time, I was taking methadone, and smoking a lot of crack, and still shooting heroin, and working two jobs. Yeah. And so I found these pills on the ground, and I fucking started taking them, because I thought they would help me sleep. I thought they were sleeping pills or something. But it turns out they were psych meds. And I looked them up later, and I found out they were psych meds. So then we moved to my friend's house down the street, and I thought that my boyfriend was trying to kill me. I was taking guns with me to work. I'd be walking around, riding around on my bicycle, and I'd have a gun just in my backpack. And I'd go to work, and I was selling weed at the time, too. So I was working as a bike messenger, and I was selling weed. And I don't know. I just fucking thought people were talking about me, and trying to kill me, and I thought it was real. And I've never heard voices in my life. I've never had these kind of feelings before. And then I stopped taking this medicine after two weeks, and I was completely normal again. So I find out it was the medicine. And so during this whole time, I was trying to get SSI, because I lost my job. I think it was just all this shit that happened, and then I started taking these pills. And I thought that they were helping me sleep, but they were driving me nuts, because they were psych meds. So then at that time, I applied for SSI, and I just told them what was going on, which was all that. And then I received that for a year or two. And yeah, and then started working again. But then, yeah, I just played that, told them that, because it was still kind of there, but not. When I stopped taking the pills, it all kind of cleared up, you know. Yeah, so that's when the personality disorder thingwhen I was diagnosed with that. And they were really vague aboutI guess. I don't know. But yeah, it was just a lot of stuff all at once, you know. So yeah. I:\tIt sounds extremely [45:34 crosstalk] intense. R:\tYeah, it was a lot. And on top of it, I was on fucking drugs. But I think the main thing was those fucking pills. Yeah, because I found out that they were psych meds. I:\tHave you ever thought that you might have an emotional or mental health condition that wasn't ever diagnosed? R:\tNo, no. I:\tSo depression, anxiety, stuff like that? R:\tSometimes with the anxiety, but I just go do stuff, and keep myself busy. Sometimes I do have a hard time sitting still. You know, I have to constantly be doing something, yeah. I:\tSo maybe some stuff, but not ... R:\tYeah. I:\tYou've never felt like you've had anything really extreme going on that ... R:\tNo, no. I:\tSo if you were self-diagnosing, you were thinking, oh, maybe a little bityou mentioned having a hard time sitting still, so maybe something ADHD-related or something like that? R:\tMaybe, maybe. Sometimes, yeah, it's really hard for me to get to sleep, settle down, sit down. If I just have my day off, I would just be like, what the fuck? I have nothing to do. Then I'll fucking be doing five things at once, you knowcleaning the house, drawing something, sewing something, watching TV, taking my dog out in the middle of that, bring heryou know, people told me that it's annoying that I can't sit still sometimes. I just always like to be doing something, you know. I:\tThank you for sharing that. So have you ever thought that you might have some kind of learning disability or some kind of processing issue that you never had diagnosed? R:\tHmm-mm [no]. I:\tSo have you ever taken medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or ... R:\tMm-hmm [yes?]. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental hospital, unit, or treatment program? R:\tI think this is what helped me get SSI when I applied so fast, yeah. So I was admitted to one when I was, I think, 14, because I'd sit there in class, and I'd be so fucking bored. I'd just be with an eraser, going like this, you know, and make marks on myself. So my dad and mom thought it was disturbing. I:\tAnd they had you admitted to ... R:\tYeah, yeah. And then one time, I had this really cool knife, and I was getting into punk rock, and I was in a gothic/industrialI was like, oh, yeah, vampires are cool and blah, blah, blah. And I remember I was cutting myself like this. You know what I mean? And they thought I was trying to kill myself. And I was like, no, I just have a really cool knife. Yeah, so that was, I think, two times I got admitted when I was a kid, yeah. I:\tHave you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of an emotional or mental health condition? R:\tNo. I:\tYou mentioned that you had a therapist that you talk to. R:\tOh, I do have a therapist. Yeah, yeah. I:\tAnd you're currently talking to a therapist? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tCould you tell me about the times that you were admitted to a placeI mean, as much as you remember, as much as you feel comfortable? R:\tYeah, there was a lot of people there. It was really crazy and shit. There'd be other kids there that were kind of there for the same thing, and we'd just sit there and laugh, and just tell jokes and smoke cigarettes. And yeah, then we'd eventually get to go home, yeah. I:\tHow longoh, sorry. R:\tThis was a long time. I was 14 or something13 or 14. Parents that, you know, I guess they thought there was something wrong with their kids, because they lookedthis one girl had red hair; this other girl was into punk rock, too. And they were admitted. And there'd be kids there with real problems, like anger problems, or just because of their environment, you know. There was a kid therea girl I would talk toand her uncle was raping her, shit like that, really emotional, really bad things happening with them, you know, where they're probably there for their environment. One kid's there because he's gang-banging. He's all tatted up and shit, and he was fucking 14 years old or something. What the fuck? Yeah, just because I think there was people there with kind of more different issues, I guess. I:\t[50:02 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah, I think so, yeah. My parents are really traditional, my dad's side. I lived with my mom's side my whole life. And then lived with my dad's side, and they're fucking gun-toting butt-rocker, listening to heavy metal kind of, you knowdifferent kind of punk rock lifestyle. And then my dad's side, all really traditional. They didn't watch TV, you know. All they do is study and work, you know. I:\tWas there a reason why you moved in with your dad's side when you were 13 or 14? R:\tYeah, me and my cousin went to a party, and we didn't have nowhere to go after the party. So we stayed in this barn that was by my grandma's house. And we fucking made a fire, because we needed light, you know. And the whole thing went up in flames, and it caught fire to some little abandoned house in front of it. And yeah, that was the reason I came back to here, to live with my dad. It wasn't on purpose, you know, but, yeah, it was enough where my mom was like, yeah, you got to go back to California. Yeah. She had to pay for it, you know. And it was an abandoned thing, so it wasn't being used. It hadn't been used for years. So yeah, it was just kind of a thing where like, oh, she's out of control; take her. I:\tThanks for sharing. Could you tell me about the times that you've been receiving counseling? So I guess your therapy. How long have you been seeing your current therapist? R:\tJust recently, maybe in the last five months. I:\tYeah? How's that going? R:\tIt's okay, yeah. Just talk to her, you know. I:\tDo you get along well? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAnd you like her, and do you think it's helpful? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHave you ever seen a therapist before in the past? Yeah? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tMore than once, or for long periods of time, short periods of time? R:\tI was for two years, yeah, about four years ago, yeah. I:\tHow was that [52:10 crosstalk]? R:\tIt was cool. It was someone I'd meet up and talk to every week, you know. Yeah. I:\tAnd it was helpful? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHas any [52:20 unintelligible] ever been court-ordered, or has it always been that you've done it on your own? R:\tDone it on my own, yeah. I:\tDo you feel that you have an emotional or mental health condition now? R:\tNot really a condition, but just really void and null, you know. I'm just no emotions, even hardly about sex; just really bored a lot of times. I don't know what it is. But, yeah, I mean, when I got sober, I just really fucking feel disassociated with a lot of stuff; no pleasure in anything most of the time, you know. I don't know what it is. I:\tDo you feel depressed? R:\tWell, I did. Not anymore, really. Yeah. I:\tThank you for sharing that. Also let me know if you get chilly, or if you want to move inside the library or something. Just let me know. R:\tOkay. All right. I:\tHow would you say that your emotional and mental health concerns have changed over the years, if at all? R:\tMental what, health concerns? I:\tYeah, emotional and mental health concerns. Did you used to think about it at all when you were younger, or R:\tMmm [no?]. I:\tIs there anything you'd like to add or talk about more about it? So next, I want to learn about your interactions with the police. So these questions might be sensitive. They could be emotional to answer. So just remember you're not required to answer any of them, and we can take a break or something [53:50 unintelligible]. So about how many times have you been arrested? R:\tOh, God, a lot of times in my life. I:\tCould be an estimation if you don't know exactly. R:\tI'm going to say 15 different times, yeah. Can we walk over this way, though, so I can grab my cigarettes? I:\tYeah. R:\tIs it okay if I smoke? I:\tYeah. R:\tOkay. I:\tSo for what offenses have you been arrested? And I'll read through a list, and you can just tell me if it's ... R:\tOkay. I:\tDUI? R:\tNo. I:\tWeapons possession? R:\tNo. I:\tDrug trafficking? R:\tNo. I:\tDrug possession? R:\tYes. I:\tFraud or forgery? R:\tNo. I:\tMotor vehicle theft? R:\tHmm-mm [no]. I:\tLarceny, burglary, assault? R:\tYeah. I:\tRobbery, rape or sexual assault, homicide or manslaughter? Any other offenses that you've been arrested for? R:\tI guess drunk in public a couple times. Shoplifting. And yeah, sales. I:\tDo they call it drug trafficking when they arrested you for it, or do they call it something else? R:\tI think it was just possession and sales. I:\tPossession and sales? R:\tYeah. I:\tWe'll just have that on the recording. Even if I should've counted it as something else, we'll have it still on the transcript. R:\tOkay. I:\tHow old are you at the time of your first arrest? R:\tProbably 19 or something, yeah. I:\tDo you remember what happened at that arrest, and could you describe the circumstances of what's going on and [55:49 crosstalk]? R:\tIt was such a small amount. I sold to a narc, and it was crack cocaine. So it was just a small amount that I had on me, and that I sold him, because I was just finishing up, that I got drug court. Yeah. And so I went to rehab. I pissed in a bottle three times a week. I'd go to court every month. And I think that was the stipulation; that was everything. I:\tHow long did you have to do thatcheck in and have [56:17 unintelligible and stuff? R:\tI think it was for a year. I:\tDid you know what was going on when you got arrested? You knew what had happened? R:\tYeah. I:\t[56:29 unintelligible] told you that they were an officer or something like that? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHow did you feel? R:\tI felt really stupid, because it was a known narc that I'd seen quite a few times. And I was just kind of really sleepy. It was really late. And I got caught by someone I'd see every day, and hide, and duck, and dodge fromthe two really known narcs of that area. Yeah, so I felt stupid. I:\tWere you scared? R:\tWell, it sucked. I had to go to jail. Yeah, yeah. I:\tHow long were you in jail for? R:\tThat time, I think it was three months, and then they released me to a program. And I did the program, completed it, and, yeah, that was about it for that. I:\tDo you feel like you were treated fairly? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tWere you read your rights and stuff? R:\tYeah. I:\tWere you able to make a phone call? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid you have access to a lawyer or a public defender? R:\tYeah, it was in San Francisco, so it was pretty common procedure. Yeah. I:\tYou said you were held for three months. Was that before they determined what was going to happen with your case? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo you were held pretrial for three months. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tThat's a long time. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat's that like? R:\tYou know, it was like normal jail time, yeah. I:\tHad you ever been in jail before? Did you have an idea about what it was going to be like? R:\tYeah, I'd been there here and there, on and off, yeah. I:\tSo you had expectations about what it was going to be like to be out there? R:\tNo, I'd just been there a couple times before that. So yeah. I:\tWhat were the circumstances that you'd been there before? Were you arrested before that? R:\tShoplifting andyeah, just minor things like that, yeah. I:\tSo do you remember the first time that you had been arrested and taken to jail? R:\tA couple times, yeah, yeah. I:\tSo a couple times before that, you'd been taken in already? R:\tYeah, because I used to boost. That was my hustle for a long time, boosting. Places like Nordstrom's had all these different outfits; make a lot of money [58:40 unintelligible]. I:\tDo you remember what went down the very first time that you got arrested? R:\tI don't remember. Yeah, that was a long ... I:\t[58:50 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah, vivid memories of being in jail for a long time, yeah. I:\tWas there anything that was really, really difficult? I mean, three months is a long time. R:\tYeah, it was just waiting; about to go to a program, so just waiting for them to have a bed open, I think. Takes a long time, yeah. I:\tSo that was through drug court. So there was a long waiting time for ... R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo about how many times have you been convicted? R:\tNever. There's all these programs where I got out of the case. I:\tThey got dismissed? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tZero convictions is what's on that record right now? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo the next set of questions is about your experience with incarceration, being in jail, and with any probation or parole you've ever had to. So did you ever go to juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd then how old were you the first time that you went to jail? R:\tI think I was 19 or something, yeah. I:\tAnd then you said you've been arrested about 15 times, going to jail each time? R:\tYeah, yeah. Well, not each time, yeah. I:\tSo how many times would you say you've been in jail? R:\tOh God, yeah, maybe three or four times. I've had to do [01:00:13 unintelligible] amounts of time, I guess. I:\tWell, I can count even times when you're held for a couple hours. R:\tYeah. So probably 15, I think, then. I:\tSo how long would you say you've served in total, of time spent in jail? R:\tIn jail? I:\tYeah. So even if it was just being held for a couple hours here, a couple hours there, a couple days. R:\tI'd say a couple months, yeah. I:\tSo three or four months, because you've got that one three-month times, and then the other times combined. R:\tSo yeah, four months. Yeah. I:\tHave you ever been to prison? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd how old were you when that happened? R:\tOh my God, I was 20 and 21. I:\tAnd how many times have you gone to prison? R:\tJust once, yeah. I:\tAnd how long were you held for? R:\tI was there for a long time, a year and a half, almost. Yeah. I:\tSo 18 months, about? R:\tYeah. I:\tWere you ever on parole or on parole? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow old were you the first time that happened? R:\tThat was 21. I:\tAnd how many times have you been on probation or parole? R:\tThat was the only time. I:\tJust that once? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd how long was it for? R:\tIt was only a year or two. I:\tIs there anything you'd like to add or talk about more? R:\tNo. I:\tSo now I'm going to read you some statements that describe how you might feel about legal authorities. So you can strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree. R:\tOkay. I:\t\"I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\t\"People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.\" R:\tI strongly disagree. I:\t\"It's difficult to break the law and keep one's self-respect.\" R:\tI strongly disagree. I:\t\"The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me.\" R:\tI strongly agree. I:\t\"People in power use the law to try to control people like me.\" R:\tI strongly agree. I:\t\"The law does not protect my interests.\" R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\t\"Most police in my city do their job well.\" R:\tI strongly disagree. I:\t\"Most police in my city treat people with respect.\" R:\tI strongly disagree. I live in Oakland. I:\tYeah? Specifically Oakland? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you want to elaborate on that? R:\tNo. I:\t\"The basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police.\" R:\tI disagree. I:\t\"The police in my city have too much power.\" R:\tI agree. I:\t\"Most police in my city treat some people better than others.\" R:\tI agree. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened, abused, or otherwise treated inappropriately by police? R:\tYes. I:\tYeah? About how many times has that happened? R:\tEvery time, from the way I look, you know. I:\tYeah? So between 11 and 20 times? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo you mean every time you've been arrested. R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. I:\tAnd you said it was by the way you looked. R:\tYeah, usually. I:\tSo what kinds of assumptions do you think they're making? R:\tWell, usually, I'm a drug user; I'm a gang-banger; or I'm up to no good, you know. Like, what are you doing? Yeah. I:\tWhen was the last time that you were unfairly stopped, or searched, or physically threatened, or abused by police? R:\tIt was maybe a year ago. I:\tA year ago? Do you remember what happened? Could you describe it? R:\tYeah, I was in Kentucky. And I was in a Wal-Mart, and I didn't pay for a salad that I was eating, and they took me to jail for three days. I:\tWow. R:\tYeah. And ... I:\t[01:04:18 unintelligible]? R:\tYeah, somewhat. Yeah. I shouldn't have done that, because I was in Kentucky. And yeah, three cops beat me up and fucking, yeah, were calling me a nigger, and fucking beating me when I was on the ground and stuff. It was like, yeah, that's Kentucky, yeah. I got out of there as soon as I got out of jail. Yeah, I had bruises all over my legs and shit. It was like, what the fuck? Yeah. So yeah. I:\tDid you try to file any kind of report or ... R:\tNo, I just got the fuck out of there. Yeah. I:\tDid you feel like you couldn't file a report, or you ... R:\tYeah, I couldn't. Yeah, yeah, small town and shit. I:\tWere you there visiting a friend or something? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo to what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with police? R:\tYeah, yeah. They're racist, kind of, you know. If you're of a different race, they pretty much think thatyou know what I mean? You fit a stereotype, you know, whatever it may be. Yeah. I:\tSo you feel like it's affected the way that police have treated you and do treat you? R:\tYeah, yeah. I've been fucked with by a few cops that did some really humiliating shit. Yeah. I:\tWould you feel comfortable sharing? R:\tYeah. One time, when I'd sell crack, me and a bunch of people got handcuffed against the wall, and then another set of Hondurans got handcuffed against a different wall. And basically, yeah, they were just, yeah, racist, like, oh, you're selling crack, yeah. Sprinkled a bunch of crack in my friend's head, like, oh, well, this monkey bitch will pick it out for you all nightjust really gross, racist shit, you know. And yeah, just, yeah, unfair, yeah. Yeah, next. I:\tIs there anything you'd like to add or talk about more about that kind of treatment in those kinds of situations? R:\tYeah, it's just really gross, because it's like, wow, really? It's 2020 almost, and there's still racist cops in huge, big cities, you know. And yeah, that's about it. I:\tWell, thank you for sharing. R:\tUh-huh [yes]. I:\tSo the next set of questions are about the arrest that led to your most pretrial detention experienceso the most recent time you spent in jail, just waiting on a decision about your case. R:\tUh-huh, yeah. I:\tSo could you tell me about the circumstances that led to that most recent pretrial detention? R:\tYeah, me and six of my friendswe were at a Safeway. And it's really fucked up. This one dude I was with, he was shoplifting, and I saw him shoplifting. I was like, what the fuck are you doing? And you ain't going to tell me you're shoplifting? Put that back. And he's like, oh yeah, okaybecause he was drunk. And then he grabs something else on the way out. And basically, these two security guards beat him up. So me and two of my friends were pretty much stopping the security guards from beating him up. And so one of my friends, she grabbed this guy's pants, and I guess his pants fell down. So that was some charge or whatever she got. It was really funny. And I can't remember what I did. Oh, I threw a road cone at one of the security guards. So I got anger management. I:\t[01:07:48 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHow long were you held for? R:\tI think I was there for a day or somethingor two. I:\tDo you feel like you were treated fairly? R:\tNot really, but then I had a lawyer at the time. It was a personal lawyer. I:\tOh yeah? So a private ... R:\tYeah, my friend had a public defender. And so they worked together, which was cool, because my lawyer kind of really helped her case, as well, you know, because they were working together. Yeah. I:\tDo you mind if I ask how you were affording the private attorney? Was that ... R:\tI had this attorney for another case, because I hired an attorney this other case, because me and two of my friends were at a punk show, and we were getting on a train. And we got on a train, and we all got arrested, because they said that we were doing graffiti, and we stole a homeless man's ladderjust all this dumb shit, which I guess all these otherbecause there was a punk show, so all the kids were getting on the same train and walking the same route. So this guy pointed me and two of my friends out; said it was us, you know, and all these punk rockers look alike anyway. So that was basically that. And so it was basically the same department. So I picked him up again. I:\tSo in that case, you'd hired the lawyer the first time ... R:\tYeah, yeah. And so I guess it was the same courtroom. I got him again. They just automatically called him or something. So I was like, okay. So just paid him again, yeah. I:\tWere you able to make a phone call when you got arrested the time you were held most recently pretrial? R:\tI don't think so, yeah. We were in a cell where the phones didn't work, yeah. I:\tDid you know why the police were stopping you, and arresting this most recent R:\tOh yeah, we all got arrested because of theyeah. And no one got hurt. It wasn't an assault and battery. We never struck anybody. I think, yeah, I threw a road cone at a security guard. And they were beating the shit out of our friend. And my friend, I think, grabbed one of the guys by the pants. So I guess that was called an assault. Yeah. But, yeah, no, there was never a fist fight besides them beating the shit out of a friendthat completely walked away from the whole incident while me and my friend got anger management for trying to help him for getting the shit beat out of him. Yeah, that dude sucked. Yeah. I:\tAnd you say you were held for a day that time? R:\tYeah, which I was grateful for, you know, because I was like, man, I don't want to be here. I:\tThat felt like a short amount of time to you, so you were grateful about that? R:\tYeah. I:\tCould you tell me what it was like for that day? I mean ... R:\tYeah, I was in there, in the same holding cell as my friend. So she just was talking nonstop and wouldn't shut up. And for me, extreme stress, because I was on methadonebecause the time before, with the other lawyer, I was held there four days without getting dosed. So I was really sick. And I was just in fear that that would happen again, you know. Yeah. So she wouldn't shut up, and there was just extreme stress that I wouldn't get out, and I'd be sick. So that was really very stressful, uncomfortable. I:\tDid you feel like if you'd asked someone for help, you would have gotten it? R:\tWell, the last time, I didn't. So I was kind of scared that that would happen again. Yeah. I:\tAnd was there anyone else being held at the same time as you besides your friend? R:\tA lot of people; not in the same cell, though. I:\tWhat were the biggest challenges that you faced while you were being held for that day? R:\tThat was basically it, yeah. I:\tYou were worried about being sick? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tAnd feeling stressed about ... R:\tYeah. I:\tCould you describe any informal rules of behavior that you felt like you had to follow? Was there any rules that you felt like you had to follow for managing conflicts with guards, or for other people who were being held, anything like that? R:\tNo, not at that time, no. I:\tWere there other times that you felt like there were informal rules of behavior in jail? R:\tYeah, sometimes. Yeah, you know, they'll just fuck with you because they're cops, you know; treat certain people different ways, you know. Yeah. I:\tWere there any responsibilities or obligations on the outside that you couldn't fulfill during that day that you were being held? R:\tYeah, because the timeI couldn't make calls, you know; wasn't a respectable hour, I guess. And then by the time that they're moving you somewhere else, then you can't make your phone calls, you know. So yeah. I:\tSo there were some responsibilities and stuff that you couldn't meet during that day? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWas it work-related stuff, or [01:13:04 crosstalk] ... R:\tYeah. Yes, yeah. I:\tDid you make any arrangements, or were you able to make any arrangements so that those responsibilities or obligations could be handled? R:\tWell, I got out the next day, so I didn'tyeah. I:\tSo were there any services or programs available to you while you were being detained? Did anyone make anything available to you [01:13:29 crosstalk]? R:\tNo. I:\tSo were there any services that weren't offered to you, but that you would have wanted to use if they had been offered? R:\tYeah, if I had a little more knowledge of what was going on. Yeah, I'm sure. I:\tIf someone had offered you any kind of healthcare services, would you have wanted to use them? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tDid your family know that you had been detained that time? R:\tHmm-mm, no. I:\tSo how important were phone calls to you? R:\tThey're very important when you're incarceratedsuper important. Yeah, yeah. I:\tWere you needing to make them for work-related stuff, or ... R:\tYeah, for work, health conditions, you know, let one person know you're okay and what's going on. Yeah. I:\tSo even though you didn't have access to that, they would have been really important [01:14:34 crosstalk]. R:\tYes, yeah. I:\tSo while you were being held for that day, were there any people that you thought were going to be in touch with you but weren't? R:\tNo. I:\tSo were there things that made it difficult to keep in touch with your family? I'll read you a list of things, and I know you haven't really been so much in touch with themor you weren't in touch with them at the time, so some of these might not apply, but just let me know. So, \"did not want to maintain close contact.\" R:\tNo, not apply. I:\t\"Jail was located too far away.\" R:\tNo. I:\t\"[01:15:10 unintelligible].\" R:\tYeah. I:\t\"Visitation rules were hard to work with.\" No? \"Jail is not a pleasant place to visit.\" R:\tYeah. I:\tWould you have wanted them to come see you in that day, if they ... R:\tNo. I:\t\"Lack of transportation\"? R:\tNo. I:\t[01:15:25 unintelligible] \"cost of visiting too high\"? \"Did not have access to phone\"? R:\tMmm [yes?]. I:\t\"Family members did not want to maintain close contact.\" R:\tMmm [yes]. I:\t\"I was embarrassed for my family to see me there.\" R:\tYeah. I:\tAny other ways that it was difficult to be in touch with your family at that time? R:\tNo. I:\tDid you have any desire to be in touch with them when you were ... R:\tNo. I:\tSo were you eventually released from jail before a decision was made about your case? R:\tYeah. I:\tUnder what conditions were you released? Was it on bail, on personal recognizance, on conditional release? R:\tPersonal recognizance, yeah. I:\tDid they set a bail amount for you at any point? R:\tI think so. I:\tDo you remember what it was? R:\tI don't remember, but, yeah, there was a bail. I:\tBut you didn't have to pay [01:16:20 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\t[01:16:24 unintelligible]. So could you tell me about the process for pretrial release? So what happened before they let you out? So was there a formal process? Did someone come and tell you, okay, we're letting you out now? [01:16:42 unintelligible] ... R:\tYeah, I think so. When you go to court, you kind of find everything outwhat may be going on, and what could happen. And then you have a public pretender. They give you their number. And then eventually, you can use it to call them, you know. I:\tSo before you went to court, did someone tell you, we're letting you out on personal recognizance? R:\tYeah. I:\tWas there paperwork you had to fill out? Was there ... R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHow did that happen? Did someone come to you in the cell? How did that ... R:\tYeah, someone came to you in the cell, yeah, yeah. I:\tWhat were you thinking about? What were you R:\tJust the main thingbeing stressed that I was going to be sick, or what's going on; am I in trouble, you know, big time or stuff like that, yeah. I:\tWere you given any resources when they let you out? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tWere you asked to set any goals? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd did you have any court requirements, other than coming to your court date? R:\tYeah, I think I didsome community service, which I worked at GLIDE, feeding homeless people, which I did after that pretty much all the time because I lived right across the street. And then I think I went to an anger management once a week. Had to do that for 19 weeks or something, yeah. I:\tAnd that was when you had gone to court, though, and they assigned that to you in court, right? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tBut when they first released you ... R:\tOh no, this was the pretrial release thing for the last one. I:\tSo when they released you on own recognizance and then let you out of the jail cell, did you have any court requirements right then, or did you have to go to court, and then they assigned you the ... R:\tYeah, I went to court, and then I talked to the place about what I should do. Yeah. Is that about it? I'm just curious. Are we almost done with this? I:\tThere's a little bit more. There's a little bit more about your participation in the anger management stuff. And I think there's a few questions about your housing situation, and then that's pretty much ... R:\tAll right. I'm just cold. I:\tOh yeah. Do you want to ... R:\tAll right. I:\tSo did you have any concerns while you were preparing to be let out of the jail cell [01:18:52 unintelligible] pretrial ... R:\tNo, no. I:\t... other than worried about feeling sick? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo what did you do in the period of time that you were released before you went to your court date? R:\tJust went back to work and just normal stuff, yeah. I:\tDo you experience any sorts of negative consequences as a result of being held for that day? So did you ... R:\tNo, not that particularly. Not that time, no. I:\tSo no lost partner, no lost housing, anything like that? R:\tNo, no. I:\tWas your experience in detention that time different from what you expected it to be in any way? R:\tNo, no. I:\tAnd your expectationsdo they come from being held previous times? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWere you changed in any way by detention that time? R:\tNo, yeah. I:\tDid anything different come from that period of detention? R:\tNo. I:\tIs there anything you'd like to add or talk about ... R:\tNah. I:\tThis section's about the process by which you were assessed for the diversion program, so [01:20:05 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo [01:20:08 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah. I:\tHow were you informed that you were being considered for pretrial diversion [01:20:19 crosstalk]? R:\tI think that, yeah, the public defender people or the lawyer, they tell you right when you're about to go to court, yeah. I:\tSo [01:20:27 crosstalk] the diversion program? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tBefore you made the decision to participate in the diversion program, was your lawyer helping you make sense of your options? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo [01:20:47 unintelligible] to determine if you're eligible to participate in that kind of a program, do you remember having any kind of interview where people asked you questions to see if you were eligible? R:\tSee, I don't remember, yeah. I can't remember that. No, actually I do remember. I:\tOh yeah? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo someone was asking you questions ... R:\tYeah, someone asked me, yeah. They came to the cell and asked me, I think, yeah. I:\tWhat kinds of questions were they asking? Do you remember? R:\tI don't remember that, though. I:\tWas it a pretrial officer? Do you know? R:\tI think so. I:\tDid you get along with that person? Were they ... R:\tYeah. I:\tThey were nice, and you felt comfortable talking to them? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tDid you feel like you could ask them questions? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid you feel like they explained the options? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAnd so you felt like you had enough information to make a decision about doing the program? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo what factors affected your decision to participate? R:\tI wanted to get out of jail. Yeah. I:\tDid they tell you that your charges might be dropped if you participated? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWas that a factor at all for you to do that? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo the purpose of the interview and other research about you is to determine your risk of reoffending, and also to determine if you have any service needs [01:22:06 unintelligible] to connect you to any services. Were you aware of any level of risk that you were assigned? R:\tHmm-mm [no]. I:\tWere you ever aware of an assessment made about your needs? R:\tHmm-mm [no]. I:\tHow much did you feel that the program that you did participate in helped reduce your odds of reoffending? So not at all, some, quite a bit, a lot? R:\tNot at all. I:\tSo did you just feel like [01:22:39 unintelligible] elaborate on that? R:\tIt felt like something that I had to do. You know what I mean? Anger management and then community service. But it helped me a lot, too, because then I started volunteering more at places that feed people, because that was the place I chose to do my community service. So that was pretty cool. I:\tHow do you feel like that helped you? R:\tWell, there was a group where pretty much everyone would go and talk about what's going on with them. But, also, you had to go, so people didn't want to be there. So it was just kind of a thing that I had to participate in, you know. So that's about it, really. I:\tAnd with the community service, you didn't feel like that was a helpful thing for you to be doing? R:\tNo, it was just something I had to do to get the case away from me. I:\tSo then this section's about your general participation in the project. So which diversion program did you participate in? I'll read you a list. R:\tOkay. I:\tAnd you can tell me if you hear the name of it. So own recognizance release, supervised release, pretrial diversion, court-accountable case management, court-accountable homeless services ... R:\tIt was pretrial diversion. I:\tIt was called pretrial diversion? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid it cost you anything to participate? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHow much? R:\tOh my God, it was a lot. I had to do a lot of community service just to work off fees because I didn't have money at the time to participate. It was probably $600, $700. So I had to work extra days of community service. I:\tSo you couldn't afford ... R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo they reduced it, or they waived it, and had you do community service instead? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tDid you end up having to pay any of it? R:\tYeah. Then I also still paid $500, and paid the lawyer and shit. So it was a lot of money. I:\tSo what were the conditions of your participation? You said you had to do a certain number of hours. How many hours of community service ... R:\tI think it was 80 or something, yeah. I:\tAnd you said for 19 weeks, you had to do anger management? R:\tYeah, once a week. Yeah, and go to court, yeah. I:\tGo to court a couple times? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo how long was the pretrial diversion termsor how long did this last for? R:\tI think it was a month or two, a couple months. Yep, yeah. I:\tBecause if you had the 19 weeks, that would have been, what, five months? R:\tYeah, I think so, yeah. I:\tDid the program do anything to address your needs? R:\tI really didn't have any needs at that time, so yeah. I:\tWas there any supervision involved? No? Did you get any benefits from participating? R:\tNo, because it was just kind of like, wow, this guy's beating up my friend, and we're just trying to stop them from beating him up. And I got anger management, had to pay all these court fees, and had to go to court just for trying to help a friend, you know. I:\tSo you didn't feel like you had an anger management issue that you could just deal with or ... R:\tNo, I've never had an anger management issue, so I:\tSo what have been the negative consequences associated with participatinganything negative? R:\tNo. I:\tBesides court fees and [01:26:17 unintelligible]. R:\tYeah, that's it. Yeah. I:\tCould you tell me about any other program participants that you got to know as a result of participating in the program? R:\tNo. I:\tYou didnt get to ... R:\tNo. I:\tDid you mostly keep to yourself? R:\tYeah. I:\tWas there a particular reason why? R:\tNo. Everybody wanted the same thing; to get there, get it over with, and go, yeah. I:\tWere there any staff from the program that you interacted with? R:\tThere's a few. No, not really. Just hi and bye, yeah. I:\tSo nothing more than that, really? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tNo. I:\tSo was that just because it was a straightforward thing, or why was it ... R:\tYeah, it was pretty easy. I:\tSo you'd just have to show up. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo how long were the meetings for? R:\tThey were an hour, yeah. I:\tSo the next section's about any violations of program requirements. Were there any times that someone accused you of violating any of the program requirements? R:\tNo. I:\tSo then this section's about the end of your participation in the program. So what were you told you needed to do to complete it successfully? R:\tOh, just complete my anger management classes, and pay the fees, and then, yeah, finish the community service, yeahwhich I did all that. I:\tDid you have to have any proof? Did you have to have any paperwork, or have people sign things for you? R:\tYeah, yeah, because the program was by the courthouse. So they checked you in and out. And the community serviceyou'd show up at the same place, and they would keep your information. I:\tDid you have to coordinate having people send information to the courts, or ... R:\tYeah, the GLIDE place that I volunteered at, yeah. They did that. I'd have them sign, and then I'd bring it in, yeah. I:\tWere you able to meet all those obligations? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd as far as the obligationsso you went to the classes; you did the community service; you got the forms you needed to get signed. Anything else that you had to do, or anythingokay. Can you explain how the program ended? R:\tYeah, I think the case got dismissed or something, because I was reformed or whatever from the community service and the anger management, yeah. I:\tWas there any kind of graduation ... R:\tNo. I:\tDid you have to do anything extra at the end? R:\tNo. I:\tDid you have to show up to court for somehow did they ... R:\tI don't even remember. I:\t[01:29:08 crosstalk] your case was dismissed? R:\tOnce I paid all the fees. I:\tDid your lawyer tell you, did someone in the court tell you R:\tYeah, the office that I went to. I paid all the fees, and so then it was done. And they told meyeah. I:\tAnd they told you that the charges were dropped, or the case was dismissed, something like that? R:\tYeah, yeah, yes. I:\tSo to what extent do you agree with the following? \"Overall, the program was very helpful.\" Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree? R:\tI'd say agree. I:\tWhat did you feel was helpful about it? R:\tWell, dismissed my charges for something that I don't think I should've, you know, been in jail for. So yeah. I:\tAny other ways that it was helpful? R:\tMmm [no]. I:\tNo? Were there any ways that it was unhelpful or counterproductive? R:\tNo. I:\tWould you recommend program participation to other people? R:\tYeah, if they want to get a case dropped. Definitely. I:\tSo not to help them in some other way, but if they get the option to get their charges ... R:\tNo, yeah. I:\t... dropped by doing that, you would recommend it? R:\tYeah, for sure. I:\tAre there any issues that you think required addressing in terms of how the program treats its clients and addresses their needs? R:\tYeah. If you really don't have the money, you know, maybe more programs where you can work it off, you know, shit like that, yeah. I:\tDid the program prepare you to deal with challenges in any way after program participation ended? R:\tYeah, I guess so. I:\tHow so? R:\tIf you get mad and angry, what to doyou know what I meaninstead of just putting hands on somebody, or fighting, or getting in their face, you know. I think there was different things you could do, things like that. I:\tDo you feel like you have access to people you can contact if you need help? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you feel like you have supports in place if things become difficult in your life? R:\tYeah, yes. I:\tSo this set of questions is about some of your most immediate experiences after your most recent release from jail. So could you tell me about the day you were released most recently, and walk me through it? R:\tIt was 1:00 in the morning, so I walked home, yeah. I:\tWhen was this release?

I:\tSo personally, you would disagree, because not for you, but in general, you think it is a big factor. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo I'm going to mark disagree just for you personally, but I totally have that on our [01:40:05 crosstalk]. R:\tOkay, okay. I:\tSo where do you see yourself in terms of work or employment in the next year, the next five years, the next ten years? R:\tI don't know. I:\t[01:40:19 crosstalk] want to go back to school?

R:\tNo. I:\tAnd if anything comes up, too, feel free to contact me if you're like, oh wait, I really want to know this, and I don't remember. R:\tOkay. I:\tSo some of the things we talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable topics. Was there any topics or questions that you thought were particularly uncomfortable? R:\tNo. I:\tSo to help us stay in touch with you for further questions if necessary, I want to ask for contact information on family members or friends who are close to you. So in case you change your phone number, and I have just no way of reaching you, are there any people that could be friends or family members who I could get in touch with, who I could reach you through? R:\tNo, no. My number's pretty much the same. It's been the same for four years. And if I lose my phonewhich I'm not planning on doingI'll have the same number or the same plan, you know. I:\tIs there even just one person who I could reach you through? R:\tYeah, I guess, yeah. I:\tAnd their contact information will be private. And also, if we ever had any reason to contact this person, we wouldn't be sharing anything that you and I talked about. It would just be ... R:\tOkay. So the person's name is [NAME]. And the number is [NAME]. I:\tIs that a friend? R:\tYep. I:\tDo you know his address? R:\tNo, he doesn't have one right now. I:\tDoes he live in Oakland, though? Does he stay around Oakland?

It's been working. R:\tYep, mm-hmm. I:\tAnd [01:43:23 unintelligible]. Okay. R:\tIs that it? I:\tThat's it. R:\tOkay, cool. Sorry; it's just cold out here. I:\tOh no, it's okay. End of recording.

And family means blood or legal relatives; people you have a child in common with; significant others; or guardians youve lived with. R:\tOh, very well. I:\tAnd they go from strongly agree to strongly disagree. If any of them dont apply, you can say so. So, please respond to the following statements. I feel close to my family. R:\tNo, negative. I:\tStrongly disagree or disagree? R:\tThe question is, I feel strongly opposed to my family. I:\tYou can phrase it that way, or it could be that you say you feel close to your family. R:\tI feel close to my family. I:\tYou do? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo, you agree with that or strongly agree? R:\tI agree that I feel close with my family. I:\tI want my family to be involved in my life. R:\tCertainly. Yes, yes, yes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYes. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tWell, theres different kinds of support. Theres financial. Theres spiritual. Theres moral support. So, which one are you talking about? I:\tAny or all of the above. Well actually touch on those more specifically later, but its generally speaking. R:\tYeah, Im a social support for my family. I:\tSo, agree or strongly agree? R:\tAgree. I:\tMy family is a source of support for me. R:\tYeah, sure. I:\tAgree? R:\tYeah, agree.

R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tI am criticized a lot by my family. R:\tNo. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tStrongly disagree, yeah--as far as I know. I:\tThe next set of questions is also from strongly agree to strongly disagree. I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk. R:\tStrongly agree. Yeah, absolutely. I:\tHow many of those people? R:\tAbout three. I:\tI have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem. R:\tWhats the middle one? I:\tNeutral. R:\tNeutral, yeah. I:\tSo, how many? R:\tTwo. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tRestate that. I:\tIf you were looking for a place to live, someone in your family would help you out with finding a place. R:\tNo. I:\tYou disagree? R:\tI disagree, yeah. I:\tStrongly or just disagree? R:\tI just disagree. I:\tSo, none of those people, you would say--zero? R:\tI would say so, yeah. I usually take care of all my business myself.

I:\tHow many? R:\tTwo. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support. R:\tSure, yeah--two. I:\tAgree or strongly agree? R:\tYeah, agree. I:\tFamily and friends can be important source of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that are not in our best interests and be sources of stress. Can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends that provide good examples of both supportive and destructive or stressful influences on your life? R:\tWell, theres no one in my family that does anything destructful for me or to me. What was the other part of the question? I:\tAs far as good influence, supportive influence R:\tOh, yeah, I have good, supportive interests. I:\tCould you tell me about them? R:\tWell, were all very close. We support our parents. We just lost our mother. And were all coming together to support our father, whos also dying, really. So, we all come together for that. Were a very strong family support for that. Absolutely. I:\tSo, you would say that this is emotional support, or how would you characterize it? R:\tEmotional. Yeah, mostly moral and emotional. I:\tThe next set of questions is about your relationships to people outside your family. So, think about three people whom you feel closest to personally, like friends, for example. R:\tSure. How about a girlfriend? I:\tIt doesnt include romantic partners, and it doesnt include family, either. So, how many friends, up to three, do you feel closest to, considering the circumstances? R:\tOh, well, I have several friends of that nature. Is the first question how many? I:\tYeah. So, its three? R:\tId say three. I:\tAnd this third person that youre thinking of--is it a male or a female? R:\tTheyre all males. I:\tAnd how would you describe his race or ethnicity? R:\tWell, one is Latin. Ones Greek. I:\tLets stick with the first one. Lets say the Latin one. How old is the Latin guy? R:\tFifty-one. I:\tNow what about the Greek guy? R:\tForty-eight. I:\tFor the Latin guy, whats the highest level of education hes completed? R:\tHigh school. I:\tAnd is he currently working for pay? R:\tYes, absolutely. I:\tIs he currently receiving public aid? R:\tNo, hes a musician. Hes one of my musician friends. He lives in San Bruno. I:\tIs he currently living with a partner? R:\tNot a partner in the sense that he has a relationship with him, but he lives with a roommate. Hows that? I:\tSo, you would say youre not sure how you would characterize it? R:\tJust a roommate; thats it. Just a person you live with. Hes renting a room. I:\tSo, for the Greek person, how old is he? R:\tForty-eight. I:\tAnd whats the highest level of education hes completed? R:\tIm not sure. High school, I guess. I dont know what his college or after high school--I dont know what that is. I:\tIs he currently working for pay? R:\tAbsolutely. I:\tIs he currently receiving public aid? R:\tNo public aid. I:\tIs he currently married or living with a partner? R:\tMarried, absolutely. I:\tOne last person that you can think of for those three. R:\tOne last person--lives down in San Juan Bautista; another musician. I:\tRace or ethnicity? R:\tCaucasian. I:\tHow old is he? R:\tSixty-three. Hes older than me. I:\tHighest level of education hes completed? R:\tHigh school. I dont know after that; I really dont. Hes older than me. I:\tAnd you said hes a musician. Is he currently doing that for pay? R:\tNo. I:\tSo, is he working for pay at all? R:\tHes retired. I:\tIs he receiving public aid? R:\tHe does receive some federal aid, to my knowledge, yeah. I:\tIs he married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tThe next set of questions is about groups and organizations that you may be a part of, and whether or not you receive emotional and/or material support from them. So, the first one--basically, youll just say yes or no, whether or not youre a part of this organization or group. Church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? R:\tNo. I:\tRecreational club? R:\tNo. I:\tSports team? R:\tNo. I:\tMusic/artist? R:\tIm a musician. I:\tAnd how often do you participate in this music group? R:\tAbout once a week. I:\tAnd would you be able to turn to this group for emotional support? R:\tYeah, if I needed it, I would imagine so. I:\tWhat about material support? R:\tPerhaps. I:\tSo, youd say yes? R:\tI would say yeah. I:\tWhat about a crew or gang? R:\tNo. I:\tLocal government? R:\tNope. I:\tCivic association? R:\tNope. I:\tSupport group? R:\tNope. I:\tAny others that come to mind? R:\tNope. I:\tSo, the next set of questions are about employment and your employment history in particular. How old were you when you had your first job? R:\tMy first job--oh, god. I dont know--19. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life have you been employed? R:\tAll of it. Oh, no, there was five years I was an artist. I was just self-employed. I:\tYou would say most? R:\tOh, absolutely most, yeah; without a doubt. I:\tWhat skills do you bring to the labor market, and how did you learn them? R:\tI have management skills. I:\tCan you tell me about that a little bit? R:\tSure. Im able to organize an entire shop. I:\tWhat kind of shop? R:\tI work in a pipe fab shop, so Im a manager there. I run part of the shop. Im responsible for the inventory. Im responsible for materials going out and for materials coming in, which are hundreds of materials, every day. So, I have a staff of four people. And Im responsible for maintaining the organization of all these materials. I:\tHow did you learn these skills? R:\tI learned them in Silicon Valley. I worked in Silicon Valley for a number of years, before the first recession in the early 80s, when the semiconductor industry was really just beginning. Then they had their first recession in the mid 80s. So, I had to change occupation for a while; became a salesman, which I traveled around the Western United States for a bit before I finished in Los Angeles; came back home to San Francisco; and then started working again in San Francisco. I:\tSo, what, if any, skills are you trying to learn now, or would you like to learn in the future? R:\tWell, right now, my job is pretty much the same. Its very busy. Its very hectic. Im perfectly suited to handle the stress in my job--multitasking, understanding multiple situations that are going on simultaneously. Ive become accustomed to knowing how to run and understand all these situations that are going on concurrently by reporting to management, and keeping construction workers out on their different jobs all over the Bay Area. What has conditioned me for that is just experience, on-the-job experience, you know, having a fantastic memory, being aggressive and progressive, and just never, ever panicking, always remaining calm, collective, and resourceful. These are self-taught. I mean, I did learn many things in school, in college, and some other side classes, as well. But all together, those things have taught me how to understand the workplace, how to run a staff, and how to deal with management. Those are all things that come into play every day. I just happen to be very good at them. I:\tSo, are there any other skills that you want to add to the ones that you already have, or things that you want to do in the future, skills that might be required to do them? R:\tId probably like to be a little bit more computer-savvy. Im a little bit, but not a lot. I:\tTechnological skills? R:\tYeah, Im not real tech-savvy. Im rather low-tech. But my job doesnt require high-tech. Theres an office full of computers and people upstairs where if I need something done online--but like I said, Im a manager. I just have those people do it. I:\tWhat barriers to employment have you had? R:\tNone. Ive never had barriers to employment, thank god. I dont consider any barriers. I cant recall a barrier to employment. Im 59. Ive only had five jobs my entire life, and the one Im at now has been for pretty much the last quarter-century. I:\tWhats the job title that youre currently working? R:\tIm a shop manager. I:\tAnd what month and year did you begin this job? R:\tOctober 1993. Yeah, it came up because I just celebrated it--23 years last week. Yeah, its pretty good. Its a great job. Its productive. Its intense. You know, keeps the mind busy physically, and its a hard job. Not many people can do it, but I can. You know what they say is, learn one good thing in life, and you should be pretty good at it. Ive learned a lot of things, but I did learn how to manage multiple situations--not to panic, not to fear things; to attack, not to be attacked but progressive, not to be reactive but be proactive. So, Ive learned those things through a number of ways. I:\tAnd thats a fulltime job? R:\tAbsolutely, yeah. I:\tHow did you get that job? How did you find out about it? R:\tMy uncle. Well, I was an artist for five years, and then my art was slowing down a little bit, you know, after I produced over 700 pieces of art and sold them around, you know, San Francisco for a while. I:\tWhat kind of art? R:\tIt was string art. It was really fabulous string art, meticulously string images of whatever images--sports, abstract, for companies, you know, that sort of stuff--logos, whatever. But I was getting burned out, because it was intense, you know, because I had to support myself, and I was getting a little burned out. My uncle mentioned, hey, theres an opening over here. Ive got a friend. You know, hes looking for somebody, you know, just to be a driver, you know, just to drive the trucks. Thats how I started out. Eventually, I just became a manager. I:\tThe artist job sounds it requires a lot of continual creativity. R:\tAbsolutely. I was continuing multiple pieces of art constantly. And I had places to sell them--bars, restaurants, friends, shows. You know, you put on art shows--you know, music, and art, and stuff [00:21:52 inaudible]. I did a lot of that. I sold a lot. And I supported myself for five years in my apartment in San Francisco. That was a great time in life. It was a fantastic time--just to support your own life in a great city. It was a wonderful time. I:\tEven more difficult to do that here in San Francisco now, it seems. R:\tAbsolutely; its very tough, very tough to be a single solo artist and depend only upon yourself to generate your income for living. But back then, in the 80s, it wasnt so difficult. I had a very low rent, very nice landlord. It all worked out. It was great. But that was, you know, 24 years ago--quarter-century ago. Things were quite a bit easier. I:\tSo, youve described some of your past work experiences. Could you explain a little bit how your current job compares to those--how you would describe it as being different, perhaps? R:\tWell, its different because I dont have to depend on myself to create the productivity, you know, to create, to draw, to write, to go out and get work, get commissions, you know, get customers. I dont have to do that. Now Im at a company that already has all that. All I do is maintain the productivity, the daily requirements of supporting job sites all around the Bay Area--hospitals, stadiums, schools, public work shows. Our contracts are multimillion-dollar contracts. I work at a very rich company. And Im one of the main people there--highly trusted, with a great reputation that I developed over 23 years of working there. I:\tRespect. R:\tAbsolutely. It takes a lot to develop something like that. Ill never look for another job again--I dont believe so. Im going to retire in five or six years. I:\tWhat about in terms of the amount that you earn with your past jobs compared to your current one? R:\tThis is the highest-paying job I ever had, absolutely. I:\tBy a large margin, would you say? R:\tYeah, by a significant margin. No doubt, no doubt. I:\tCan you tell me about your most positive work experience? R:\tWell, its daily, really. Its just taking care of and satisfying everybody out there, you know. Our company--were working on seven, eight, nine jobs concurrently, all over the Bay Area. And every job has a job site foreman, and theyre very demanding. They need stuff now--need it right now, need it tomorrow, need it first thing in the morning. I get that every day. There is high stress, but I know how to handle that stress, and I understand the business. I understand whats going on. I understand whether theyre faking me or theyre not. I call them up. Do you really need this? You really got to have this down? Whats the problem? Whats going on? I have that authority; that ability to question other people. You need it tomorrow morning? How about the next day? Oh, I can get away with that. I just want to know on parameters. Thats why I contact people; I talk to them personally. The personal touch goes a long way. I:\tIndeed. R:\tIndeed it does. Well, I know these people. Ive known them for years. They know Im going to take care of them. They know it. I just need a little more time--a little busy right now. Well get it done; dont worry about it. Forget about it; its done. Thats it. Its a reputation you develop with people. Its like money in the bank. Reputation is money in the bank. I:\t[00:26:10 inaudible]. R:\tOh, absolutely. No doubt about it. You commit to a man, Im going to get you this when I said Im going to get it to you. If I cant get it right now, theres a reason for that. But if I say Im going to get it tomorrow or even a few hours later, its going to be done; forget about it. Its over; its done--99% on that. And they fail once in a while. I understand the failure. Its always a possibility. But not trying to get it done should not be a possibility; should always try to get it done--your best effort. Thats it. I:\tWhat about your most negative work experience? R:\tWell, you get people who are very unhappy sometimes, you know--people who arent foremen. You get people down in the ranks, you know, getting a little hot-headed, you know. You got to deal with those phone calls, too. And I just have to, you know, set them right. And I get phone calls all the time. I get, you know, 30, 40 phone calls a day right there, just coming through. I have to calm them down. I have to tell them just like their foremen, their bosses. I usually deal with only the bosses or the superintendents, but I do get calls from their subordinates who are hot-headed--well, not hot-headed, but theyre very anxious. God, [NAME], you got to get me this. I need it now. Im sorry; I cant do it right now. Ive got other things Im dealing with. Ill get it to you. Its still the same thing--whether theyre foremen, or the superintendent, or whether theyre down the rank; doesnt matter. I treat everybody the same. If you need something, Im going to get it for you as soon as I possibly can. But they must realize--and I make them realize--that Ive got multiple situations going on right now. When you called me right now, Im already dealing with someones hot issue right now. So, what, you want me to drop their stuff; want me to set them aside for you? I dont think so. Theyre in line first; take care of them, then Ill get to you. That could cost a day; it could cost half a day. It might cost two days. I dont know. But at least theyre real. This is real. This is reality. You got to tell people about reality. A lot of people think they can get this stuff right away just because they say so or they demand it to be so. But thats not always the case. I got to straighten them out. Its not real. I dont even have that right now. I got to buy that. I dont know when its coming in. Thats the reality; deal with it. Just have to tell people what the reality is. If I could do it, Ill do it right now. If I cannot do it, I cannot do it. Thats it. Its beyond my reach, but Ill get it done. Might take a little longer, but it will get done. Thats the reputation; they know Im speaking the honest truth, and thats all they expect of me. I dont lie to people. Im straight up. This is whats going on. I:\tGot to break the news. R:\tYou got to break the news. But most of the time, it always gets done. It might take a day, two days. Some things are hard to get sometimes, especially in the plumbing structure business. Not everythings on the shelf. Not everythings waiting for you to order it. A lot of times, I dont have things, you know. Its just life. So, I tell them. I call them up personally. This is what the story is. This is what the deal is right now. Sorry. I tried. It just aint happening right now. Okay. Get it when you can. Thats it. All right. Bam. I:\tIs there anything you want to add or talk about more related to those set of employment questions? R:\tWell, you know, every days pretty much the same. I understand more than these people that are out in the field. Ive been there, like I said, 23 years. Ive been through every situation. One thing I do have knowledge of is, Im also what they call a bid runner. I run the bids for the company. I go--the last person to take a $5 or a $10-million bid to a contractor; very nerve-wracking process. In other words, the estimators, the bidders up there--you know, they do all their numbers, you know. They were bidding $5 million, $5.7 million, you know, whatever on this job. When you get there, the numbers may change, okay? So, be a contact by phone, and what well do is, when you get there--and usually, I get there an hour ahead of time--the number changes, because youre always trying to get the lowest number. A bid is about winning the job by having the lowest offered bid--you know, beating out the competitors. Sometimes, you know, you can beat them by $1 million; sometimes, you only beat them by $500,000. Who knows? You dont know. Theres several people bidding on all these jobs, you know. All these construction people--its heavy competition, like anything else in any industry. Competition is heavy, even on jobs like maybe a $5-billion school job--a high school or something. Theres probably seven or eight companies whove, you know, constructed their bid to be competitive and to win that job--to be the lowest bidder to win that job. So, the numbers--I got to write numbers, you know, at the last minute, like $5 million. You cant get one digit wrong. And then you got to spell out--its nerve-wracking when it involves millions of dollars. I made a million-dollar mistake one time, and it didnt come into play. We didnt win the job, but I was told about it. You know, hey, you screwed up by $1 million. Oh, sorry. But that was the only time. But, you know, Ive run, you know, 100 bids. And Ive won a lot of bids. Ive got it right. I was the last man standing; came back to the company. Bam, we won the bid. So, I have that, also, in my back pocket, that skill--to be able to handle great pressure in a short amount of time. And thats why Im in the position I am--because I can handle pressure. That takes a skill right there--handling pressure. A lot of people cant handle pressure. People get flustered [00:32:40 inaudible] too much pressure, you know. I dont want to deal with all this pressure. A lot of people dont want to deal with pressure. Its tough. Its nerve-wracking. It works on you. You make a mistake; youre scared of making a mistake, you know. Im not. I can make a mistake and live through it. I have made a lot of mistakes. Im not perfect. Nobodys perfect. But I know how to deal with it, and they know that Im fearless. And thats why I do what I do. Thats why Ive done it for a long time. And then I relax at the end of the day. I know I did my very, very best each and every day. I go home, and I sleep. I watch Law and Order: SUV, Criminal Intent. I see the pressure. You know, pressures having a gun in your face, you know. Pressures, you know, raising a family; not having a job. Thats pressure. I havent had kids, but Ive lived a good life because I handle pressures Ive had before. Nothing really fazes me. I have people around me that have a lot of pressure on them. I learn from them. I learn from people around me; understand what their life is like. Im close to the people who work for me and work around me. I understand whats going on; very personable. I treat everybody with respect. Thats why I get great respect around my company. People call me sir [00:34:11 inaudible] a suit or nothing, but they know what Im doing. They know what Im getting done every day. Now of course, a lot of youngsters are working for us now. So, sir, can I help you with this? Thank you, sir. Sorry to bother you, sir. I dont act like a sir, because, you know, this is how I dress. Im getting dirty every day, but Im called sir because of this. I:\tWhat about substance abuse? The next set of questions are about substance abuse, if any. Remember that all of your responses will be kept private. Have you had any experience with substance abuse? R:\tNo, I dont abuse anything. Im very moderate; drinking a beer here or there. I:\tSo, you would say neither? R:\tYeah, very moderate. I keep everything to a bare minimum, just to go out, socialize, you know, have a cigarette, drink, relax. But Im always home on time to rest; get to work the next day. In fact, this year, Ive had perfect attendance. You know, Im 59, and I go out. Yeah, I go out, and watch games, or hang out with friends. Im a musician. I go out and do shows. Im always in those situations, but Im always conscious; keeping it down to a minimum. Well, first of all, if you want to perform on stage, you dont want to be high or buzzed. If youre a true professional, you dont drink until later; maybe have one beer during the show to loosen you up. But Im always of the mind  I want to be at my best. I want to sing well. I want to perform well. Thats it. Ill have a little bit later, but the show comes first, because Im a professional. Same thing within the group, within the band members. They see that and respect that, wow, [NAME]s giving his all, his best; came here always clear-minded, ready to go [00:36:08 inaudible] lets do a show. Bam, thats it. Same thing on the stage; its the same level of professionalism  only in that circumstance, you know, not like at work. I mean, you dont drink at work. No one drinks at work. No one smokes at work. Well, Ive heard of people doing it, but theyre knuckleheads. You dont do that shit. You do that shit on your own fucking time. You dont do it on work time. Work is for work. Socializing is socializing. Keep the two separated. But with music and entertainment, you do have that ability to knock down a few, you know. And believe me, Ive been around players who fucking had too much. You know what? Youre high. Youre really high. I can tell youre high [00:37:00 inaudible]. Lets see. You know, Ive seen players fuck it up on the stage  because why? A little too much; just werent as sharp, lost a lyric here, missed a chord here. You know, something like that. And its not my job to police them, but Im aware of it. Im going to say something, because youre sharing a stage with me; you got to give me your best. I dont want no flunky. Ill get another guy. Thats how you tell people. Thats it. I:\tI feel you, man. I feel you; got to be in control. R:\tYou got to be in control, moderation--especially if youre a professional; youre getting paid. People are paying you to be on stage. And youre going to be not at your best? Because what? Because youre doing this? Save it for later. I mean, you can have one or two, but moderation. But dont be getting all messed up on my stage. Otherwise, you know, I wont let you on the stage. I:\tIts not funny. R:\tIts not funny, believe me. Ive seen people blow it on stage  because you know? Theyre just not professional. You learn that after a while. That persons out. You know, sorry, man [00:38:09 inaudible] we hit the stage; were the best  at rehearsal and on the stage. Thats the difference between an amateur and professional. So, I try to maintain that standard, even though I am able to drink in that situation. Ill have a beer or two, because I know my limits. And after, Ill have another one or two. But remember, after the shows over, you got to get home safely, too; cant be, oh, [00:38:37 inaudible] you know. Ive seen guys do that; just say, calm down, dude. You got to drive 20 miles to get home. Chill; have some water, and then go home. So, Im always looking out for people, including myself, number one. I:\tWhat about mental or emotional health issues? R:\tIm pretty good with that. I:\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or psychiatric nurse, that you had a mental or emotional health issue? R:\tNever. Never, ever. Ive never saw one. I:\tOr that you showed symptoms of one? R:\tNever. God bless, knock on wood, Ive always been pretty solid mentally. I:\tHave you ever thought that you might have an emotional or mental health condition? R:\tI never thought I had. I never did. Somehow, I just always felt level-headed; look at things in black and white, and just try to see things clearly. I:\tHave you ever taken medication prescribed by a psychiatrist? R:\tNever seen a psychiatrist. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental hospital unit or R:\tNever. I:\tHave you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of an emotional or mental health condition? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd you dont feel like you have an emotional or mental health condition now at all? R:\tNo. I:\tHow would you say that your emotional or mental health concerns have changed over the years, if at all? R:\tWell, they really havent changed. Im still really perceptive, you know, to changing things, emotions. My own policy, my whole, you know, model in life is not to get too high or not to get too low; try to stay somewhere in the middle. Like, I have a girlfriend who gets--shes hyper. She gets really high about some things--hyper, overexcited about things. And then theres times where shes really low. Shes a classic example of getting too high and getting too low. So, Im her perfect mate. I try to keep her in the middle. I tell her this all the time. But thats a physical thing. You know, its a mental thing. Its something you cant erase, but you have to teach people--even those close to you--how not to get too high, too excited about something, or too low, or depressed, or rejected, or dejected about something--that there is a middle ground, you know, for everything. There really is a middle ground. In other words, you get too high; you get flustered. You know, you get--expectations are too high or something, or youre too excited, abnormally excited about something thats rather ordinary sometimes, at least in my view  or you get too dejected, or rejected, or depressed, or sad about something thats really not worth it. Its not worth that emotional dive that one might take over being upset or not getting what they want, you know. I choose to stay in the middle. I might seem rather boring. Borings not a good word for it--or unexcited. Its because I dont want to get too excited about something--or on the same token, I dont want to get too low about something, either. I dont want to be too upset about it. I want to stay somewhere in the middle with it, and just understand that you cant always get what you want. And when you do, thats great. Its great when you get what you want. But if you dont get what you want, you dont know, you know. Dont beat yourself up, you know. Dont get too upset. Dont get wrecked about it, you know, because theres going to be another issue down the road. Theres going to be another issue thats going to come up; youre not going to get what you want. How you going to deal with that? You always getting wrecked when you dont get what you want or what you need? Sorry, but, you know, thats going to continually happen in your life. Thats why I just stay in the middle road; try not to get too high or get too low about it. Just try to stay somewhere in the middle, being realistic about whats great and whats really bad. Now granted, theres a lot of terrible things that happen. I can understand. When its a real, genuine, horrible thing [00:43:41 by a person with that], Im sympathetic and understanding about it, absolutely. But theres some things that people really get really low about, and its not that big a deal. Its not that big a deal, you know; got to get over it--or theres some things that people get too excited about. On the same token, thats not that big a deal, you know. Why you getting so woo, way up here about that? Its not that big a deal, you know. Try to keep it real. Be excited, have fun with it, yeah, but dont get too overexcited. I dont know. I just dont like overexcitement or hyper excitement. There are places for that. There are times for that, absolutely. Theres time for depression. There are times to be really sad or very upset about things that happen in life. But most of the time, there are things that [00:44:37 just fall in the areas]--just keep it real, you know. Thats my philosophy, and it kind of keeps me centered, you know. I:\tSo, anything else you want to add related to that set of questions? R:\tNot really. I mean, thats my general philosophy--is just that, you know. Just be cool, calm, and collected, you know. See things for what they are. Dont make it more than they are not, you know. Just be real. Keep things in perspective, is all I would say. Just keep it in perspective, because emotion is physical. Thats a physical thing. You get emotional about something, and you start crying or laughing too much about something, youre just too high on it. And its fun to be high on, you know, a natural high or whatever. Thats great, yeah. Outdoors, or this, or musically on the stage, that sort of thing--but theres things you just have to keep real and just keep them in perspective. And I think that keeps you centered, keeps you anchored, keeps you real; just keeps you understanding the bigger picture in life. Theres always a bigger picture. I:\tSo, the next set of questions are about arrest, conviction, and incarceration--basically, your experiences with the criminal justice system. R:\tWell, I havent had too many. You know, probably the one that this generated from is--are you going to go into that? Is that something I:\tDefinitely, definitely. R:\tWell, my experience has been well. I really havent done anything really that horrible. The horrible thing I did was, I was very angry and high, and I threatened somebody. I wanted to beat her ass about stealing $5,000 from me. And thats what this whole thing was generated from. Thats what the diversion was from. The only really diversion Ive had in the last whatever--the last one I had, thats what generated this, I believe--is the incident I had with a woman who was my neighbor, who was my friend--until she wasnt my friend. Its just she played me for $5,000. I:\tSo, Ill ask some specific questions about that in a little bit, but I just want to get a general background on your experience with the criminal justice system first with these questions. R:\tOh, yeah. Well, its really good. I mean, Ive always done well. I mean, Ive always gone in with whatever it was for; taken care of it like a professional, and just dealt with it, like any person would deal with something when something was, you know, against them generated by the criminal law system. Just being real with the public defender or whatever it was, being real with the judge, being real with your opponents in the courtroom, that sort of thing. I:\tApproximately how many times have you been arrested? R:\tWell, god, Ive only been arrested once in the last 20 years. I:\tBut what about total in your life? R:\tProbably three or four times. I:\tWould you say three or four? R:\tWell say four, sure. I:\tAnd for what offenses have you been arrested? R:\tDUI, and then the one thing--a couple times. You know, this was back in the 70s or 80s. I was just a young dummy. I:\tSo, Ill just read through the list, and you can tell me if it applies. Weapons possession? R:\tNo. I:\tDrug trafficking? R:\tNo. I:\tDrug possession? R:\tMarijuana, back in the 80s, for a joint or two joints or something, whatever it was. It couldve been the 70s. I dont know; so long ago, a lifetime ago. I:\tFraud or forgery? R:\tNope. I:\tMotor vehicle theft? R:\tNope. I:\tLarceny, burglary? R:\tNope. I:\tAssault? R:\tNope. I:\tRobbery? R:\tNope. I:\tHow was that incident characterized with your neighbor over the $5,000? R:\tLegally? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. R:\tIt was a threat to harm her. But it was not face-to-face. It was just yelling from my apartment. I:\tRape or sexual assault? R:\tNothing like that. I:\tHomicide or manslaughter? R:\tNothing like that. I:\tAnd how old were you at the time of your first arrest? R:\tMy first arrest? Oh, god, I dont know. I went to juvenile hall, I think, for a joint or two. I remember that back in San Jose. That had to be my first arrest, because my parents had to come and get me. So, I was not an adult. That places me around 16 or 17. I:\tWhich one would you go with, if you had to pick one? R:\tSeventeen. I:\tSo, could you tell me about the incident with your neighbor that you mentioned, from start to finish? R:\tYeah. Well, basically, it was just--we were asked to leave because the owner of the building was selling the building to developers, to a Chinese buyer who was going to take the building and, of course, remodel the building. So, we had teamed up with a lawyer to get more than what was being offered by the owner, which was, at a minimum, under the law at that time, it was $5,000 or $6,000. And then we went to go see a lawyer for that thing, and we went together. We were a team, up to a point. We were going to split--I dont know--$24,000 or something. I had been there 25 years, and she and her roommate had been there 5 years. So, I was due to get the most for my longevity. And they were going to get a lesser amount. And that was the agreement going in. And then during that time with the lawyer, she went behind my back--her and her roommate--to get an equal amount, which lessened my amount by $5,000 to $6,000. So, she basically played me and went behind my back to make it an even three-way split, which was going to--and did--cost me $6,000. And so that made me very, very angry; developed very much anger towards her. She was so friendly with me for a while, and I just felt so played and betrayed. And I yelled at her one night, just out of my apartment. She was next door. You know, I just yelled a bunch of shit--you know, Im going to kick your ass. You fucking screwed this up. You know, you did this. You did that. You know, youre going to pay for this, you know. And then she called the cops. So, the cops arrested me for threatening her. I:\tCould you talk about this arrest in detail? Like... R:\tWell, they just came in and said, she said you were threatening her, so... I:\tCame into your... R:\tYeah. Shes pressing charges, and weve got to take you downtown. I:\tSo, they busted into your apartment, or they... R:\tNo, they knocked on the door, and I answered the door. I:\tAnd how was that interaction when you spoke with the cops? R:\tOh, it was fine. I said, okay; Im sorry. I was just venting my frustration. And youre just cops doing your job; I understand. Lets go. Im not going to fight you; Im fighting her. I yelled a bunch of stuff at her. Yeah, I did. Im guilty of that, but I didnt do it to her face. I yelled it, you know, from my apartment. So, boom, there was only a wall separating us. And I said a bunch of shit, you know. Ill say it again if I have to, but I was pissed. No ones ever ripped me off like that. It was the first time in my life someone ever played me like that, and ripped me off like that for that amount of money. That never happened ever in my life. It generated a first-time anger that had just never come through my body before. But it came through on that one night. I:\t[00:54:18 inaudible] how did that carry over into your interaction with the police? Do you feel like you were treated fairly by them? R:\tYes, of course I was. I didnt get mad at the cops. They were just doing their job. I:\tWere your rights violated in any way? Were you read your rights? Were you able to make phone calls? R:\tOh, yeah, no, I never felt that my rights were violated. I understand the cops. They were just doing their job. And I did. I said some very mean things. So, I understood. You know, I got out in a couple days. Boom, I was out, and it was all court stuff after that, you know. And I was assigned a public defender--very nice gentleman. I forget his name. Its been a few years already; probably been three or four years since that incident. Whatever it is, thats when it was. And I got a restraining order put on me. So, I had to come home at certain hours to avoid her, because she was next door. So, I did a really good job of that. I did a perfect job of that. And we saw each other in chambers, in the judges courtroom. Thats how it went. And I did everything I was supposed to do. And then my charges were reduced or dismissed, and I had to get the diversion [00:55:37 inaudible] the diversion. I did that perfectly. I:\tHow many times have you been convicted, approximately? R:\tConvicted of what? I:\tOf a crime. R:\tLike DUI? I:\tYou were convicted of the DUI? R:\tI guess so, yeah. I paid the fines for those when I went through that. I:\tAnd how old were you when you received that DUI? R:\tOh, god, my early 20s. Yeah, 30 years ago. I:\tAny estimate around exact age, if you were to say? R:\tSo long ago, I dont even remember. No, no, its a lifetime ago. Too long ago to remember. I:\tCould you tell me about the DUI a little bit? R:\tI had too much to drink; got pulled over. I:\tWhat about going to court or anything like that? Do you recall? R:\tToo long ago. Just too long ago. I dont remember anything about it. I:\tYou dont recall how you felt when you realized you were getting a DUI? R:\tUpset. I:\tSo, this set of questions is about your experience with probation, incarceration, and parole. So, basically, it has to do with, how old were you the first time? Also, how many times youve been, and how long you served, if applicable. So, you mentioned juvenile detention. You said you were 17 then? R:\tYeah. I dont even remember. Back in those days, you were just released on your own recognizance. You paid your fine. Completely different than what it is today. Its much more expensive. Theres probably a longer incarceration, perhaps. Theres probably more public service, perhaps--Im not sure--or restriction on your license, perhaps. I:\tSo, how long did you serve when you were in juvenile detention at age 17 when you said your parents picked you up? R:\tProbably two or three days. Ive never spent more than three or four days in any incarceration. I:\tWhat about jail? How old were you when you first... R:\tJails incarceration. I:\tHow old were you when you first went to jail? R:\tAbout 17, juvenile. I:\tI mean... R:\tOh, juvenile hall. I:\tSo, Im talking about jail for people over 18. R:\tOh, jail. I:\tYeah, yeah, not juvenile detention. R:\tOh, I dont know; my early 20s, I guess. Those are usually the two or three, couple of nights, something like that--not long. I:\tHow many times have you been in jail? R:\tProbably three or four times? I:\tWhich one would you go with? R:\tThree. I:\tAnd how long total would you say youve served? R:\tTotal? I:\tYeah, total. R:\tOh, god, 10 days. I:\tAnd youve never been to prison? Okay. What about probation or parole? R:\tNever required parole. Paroles when youre in jail for a long time. You get paroled. I:\tProbation? R:\tIm sure Ive had probation from those offenses. I:\tWhat was your first age that you were on probation? R:\tMy early 20s. I:\tAnd how many times, approximately, have you been on probation? R:\tThree. I:\tAnd for how long total, would you say? R:\tProbations kind of a thing--its one or two years, or three years. I would say five years, I guess. Never violated probation. I:\tIs there anything else you want to add or talk about more related to that set of questions? R:\tNot really. Thats really all there is. I:\tSo, the next set of questions is on legitimacy of legal authority. It goes from strongly agree to strongly disagree. So, I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. R:\tNo, not really, no. I:\tStrongly disagree or somewhat disagree? R:\tSomewhat disagree. I:\tAnd why is that? Just curious. R:\tBecause the authorities are not always right. I:\tPeople should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tOf course, yes, agree. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tAgree. I:\tSomewhat agree. It is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tI disagree. I:\tSomewhat disagree or strongly disagree? R:\tJust disagree. I:\tThe law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me. R:\tThe law reflects the people in power. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tSure. I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tDisagree. I:\tSomewhat disagree? R:\tSomewhat disagree. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tNo, the law does protect my interests; agree. I:\tSomewhat disagree or R:\tAgree. I:\tSo, the statement was, the law does not protect my interests. So, you would say that you disagree with that because the law does protect your interests, correct? R:\tThe law generally protects my interests, yes. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tYes, agree. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tSure. I:\tMost police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tYes, yeah, I agree, strongly agree. I:\tThe basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police. R:\tYes, thats correct. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tSure. I:\tThe police in my city have too much power. R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\tAnd why do you say that? R:\tSome cops abuse their power. I:\tMost police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tSure, I would agree with that. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYeah, sure. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened, abused, and/or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police? R:\tNo. I:\tTo what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with the police? R:\tIt really hasnt. I dont have no racial experience with the police. I:\tIs there anything you would like to add or talk about more related to that set of questions? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tSo, the next set of questions is about your pretrial detention experiences. And this is about the arrest that led to your most recent pretrial detention. So, could you tell me about the circumstances that led to your arrest exactly? I know you touched on it a bit. R:\tRight. Yeah, I yelled at somebody and threatened them bodily harm, and thats why I was arrested. I:\tAnd how long would you say you were in detention, then? R:\tThat was three days or something. I:\tSo, what was it like when you were actually in detention? What was a typical day like? R:\tI really stayed in the same place. If I remember, I didnt really move. It was less than three days. I remember just two nights in there. It was really just a holding cell--just people coming in, people coming out. Never really got moved, because I was always on the verge of getting out. Its one of those things where youre in there, youre waiting for the right papers to come through, that sort of thing, and just, you know, it always takes longer than you would hope for. So, that was about it. It was two nights, if I remember right; wasnt very long. Long enough, thats for sure. I:\tHow would you describe the other people who were in there with you? R:\tOh, just, you know, dirty, ratty, you know, upset, angry. Yeah, you know, like most people would be when theyre in jail. Nobody wants to be, you know, behind bars, guilty or not. Its a bad place to be. Its no-mans-land. But, you know, you can tell a lot of people have been in there before, you know. Some of them were in and out a dozen times in the last year, probably, you know--street people. I:\tWhat were the biggest challenges you faced on a day-to-day basis? R:\tJust sleeping and some rest. I:\tWhat made it difficult for you to do that? R:\tOther people. I:\tWhat in particular? R:\tInmates who were loud--noisy, loud, you know, cussing inmates, angry inmates, you know. I:\tCan you describe any informal rules for behavior that you lived by while you were in detention? R:\tDont talk to anybody, unless you can deal with them. Dont talk to crazy people. I:\tWhat about any other rules that you mightve had for managing conflicts with guards or other inmates? R:\tNever had conflicts with the guards. I:\tAnd were there any other rules that you lived by in order to not look weak, or not bring about any controversy, other than not talking... R:\tKeep to yourself; thats it. Keep to yourself. I:\tSo, during your detention, did you have any responsibilities or obligations on the outside that you had to fulfill but you werent able to? R:\tYeah, work. I:\tCan you tell me about that? R:\tYeah, I missed work one day. I:\tAnd did you have any negative consequences because of that? R:\tNo, I did not. I:\tDid you make any arrangements in order to not have any negative consequences, or did you make any calls, or anything like that? R:\tYeah, I made a call to my sister, who called my job. I:\tSo, what types of services or programs were available to you while in detention? This might include educational programs, programs for anger management, and other mental health issues, medical and dental care. R:\tThe diversion was anger management. I:\tWhat about while you were actually in detention, though? R:\tNegative, nothing. I:\tYou didnt have any... R:\tNothing. Wasnt there long enough. I was released; got out; went to court. I was eligible for diversion. Went to anger management diversion. I think thats what it was. I think thats what it was labeled. I believe that was it. Yeah, it was. It was a group, you know, of people in the diversion program. I:\tSo, you didnt use any services at all while you were in detention that you can think of? R:\tNope. I:\tWere there any services that werent offered but you wouldve used, had they been offered? R:\tI wasnt aware of anything that was offered. I:\tI mean, were there any that you wanted to be offered but... R:\tNo, none. I:\tSo, connecting with family and friends while in detention. If your family knew that you had been detained, how did they react to the news? R:\tThey were sad. I:\tHow did they find out? R:\tI called them. I:\tAnd when you say they were sad, can you give me some examples of what you mean by that? R:\tYeah, they were upset that I was in jail. But I told them why, and they understood, and they knew the person involved. They understood even more. I:\tHow did this make you feel about yourself, when your family found out, and they... R:\tWell, I was upset that, you know, I lost control, that I was so upset. Once again, as I stated earlier, it was the first time something like that had happened to me in my entire life. So, I just reacted like, you know, [01:10:38 an Indian. Im part Indian] but very angry, very bad, very disrespected. After I was close with a person, you know, thats what made it worse. You get close to someone. Youre working with somebody, and they flip on you to the tune of about $5,000. Thatd piss off nine out of ten people. But eventually, I realized $5,000 is not a great amount of money. Its just an amount of money. But when it happens to you for the first time ever, that was an unpredictable response, you know. I was not prepared for that, especially being played. That cuts deep. That cuts deep. Its not like someone you didnt know. It was your neighbor that you thought you were tight with. Then they flipped on you. So, you not only lost out on the money, which I did, but you got played, stabbed in the back. I:\tHow important were visits, phone calls, and mail for you while you were being detained? R:\tI never needed it. I was only in there for a couple days. Never came into play. I:\tEven outside of contacting your sister to... R:\tThat was it. That was the only contact. My family knew what was up. They knew I was going to be out very shortly. I didnt cause physical harm. I didnt confront this individual. This yelling, this temper tantrum was made within my own living space. She simply heard it through the door. I:\tWhile you were in detention, were there people that you thought would stay in touch with you but didnt? R:\tMy people knew where I was, and they knew Id be out soon. That never came into play. I:\tWhat about people you met while you were in detention, and then you got out? Did you meet any people in detention you thought would stay in touch with you but didnt? R:\tAbsolutely not. I:\tSo, while you were detained, what were the things that made it difficult for you to keep in touch with your family? I could read some to you, or you can... R:\tPhone calls. Its hard to make phone calls. And that was it; only the phone. I:\tBail--were you eventually released from jail before a decision on your case was made? R:\tI was bailed out. I:\tWhat was your bail set at by the courts? R:\tTwenty-thousand. I want to say $20,000--something like that. I:\tAnd how much did you pay? R:\tMyself, I think I wound up paying--I remember something like $2,000 or $4,000, something like that. I had payments after that--a lump sum and then payments to a bail bondsman. Took a few minutes to knock that out, but it was all taken care of. That went very well. Everything after went, you know, smooth, you know. I:\tSo, you would say that you paid for your release using commercial surety bonds? R:\tMy sister provided the funds to get me out. I:\tPrerelease preparation--could you tell me about the process for pretrial release? Can you describe the moment that you learned youd be released and your experiences leading up to your release? R:\tYeah, I was happy to be released--and prepared myself, just, you know, mentally being happy to go. I:\tWas there a formal process that you recall? R:\tWell, yeah. They opened up the cage, and they let you out. And then, you know, you get all your belongings back. And then tell everybody thank you for letting me go. And then you leave. I:\tWere you asked to set any goals? R:\tYeah, never to come back. I:\tAnd were you given any advice? R:\tNo. I:\tWere you provided with any resources at that time? R:\tNo. I:\tWere there any specific court requirements for the release that you recall? R:\tJust bail. I:\tDid anyone help you plan out what you would do during this time? R:\tNo. I just returned to my normal life. Paid off my debt for the bail. I:\tAnd could you tell me about any concerns that you had as you prepared to be released? What was on your mind? R:\tNo, there was just getting out, carrying on. Thats it. I:\tAnd you werent concerned about your job or anything, because you already dealt with that beforehand, youre saying? R:\tNot at all. Yeah. I had a lot of flexibility in my job. I:\tWas there anything in particular that you felt was important to do at this time? R:\tIt was just to get everything right, to do everything properly and formally, and then I keep all my records, keep all my receipts, keep all the legal papers in one package. I did this. I did this. I paid for that. I went to this court. I went to that court. This was signed off; all done. Thats it; just keeping track of the paperwork generated by the legalities. I probably still have them to this day. I keep them, you know, five or six years. I understand what its like to keep records. Im in charge of records at my company. Im in charge of archives, you know. Everything a company builds, by law, youre supposed to keep all the plans, the details, everything, the drawings, paperwork that was involved, the purchases  10 years, every company--at least a construction company has to keep these records. So, I was already understanding the importance of archiving, saving paperwork as proof that I did this, and I did that. I did all the right things. Its right there [01:18:19 inaudible] no one can take that away from me. Everythings signed off. No one can come back and say, hey, you didnt do that, or you didnt do it right, or whatever, you know. You didnt complete that. You didnt complete this, or you didnt pay this. You didnt pay that. I kept everything pertaining to that case. Ill probably keep that for 10 years, even though its completely closed and Ive never heard anything of it. I never will, Im sure. But yeah, thats all well and good, I believe, now. I:\tWhat sorts of negative consequences did you experience as a result of being held in pretrial detention? R:\tI cant say there were any negative experiences. I did what I had to do, and I found it to be positive, learning a lot, sitting around in a diversion group, everybody discussing, you know, their problems, their trials and tribulations as a result of their infractions and incarcerations, you know. I:\tAnd how was your experience in detention different from what you thought it might be? Any expectations... R:\tIt was what I thought it would be; just being held in jail. Its just jail, and a lot of creepy creatures come in, and youre just dying to get out. I:\tWhere did those expectations come from? R:\tFrom being jailed before. I:\tWere you changed in any way by detention? And if so, how? R:\tWell, absolutely. I will never threaten anybody over a mere $6,000, because, you know, Im worth a lot more than that. You know, I have a lot more than that. So, dont sweat $5,000 or $6,000. Remember what I said earlier--not to get too high or get too low? Well, I broke my own law. I got too high. I got too emotional. I was pissed about that. But it was the money, you know. Money drives people crazy sometimes, especially, you know, something in the thousands of dollars that never happened to you--especially when its combined with someone who betrayed you. I:\tA lot of times, its easier to give advice than it is to live ones own life. R:\tYeah, its very tough. You set your rules, but then sometimes you break your own rules, because you confront or something happens to you thats never happened to you before, and all your rules go out the window, you know. Anger is a very powerful emotion, and when somebody turns on you like that, that way, you know, you just turn right around, and you give it right back. I mean, its very sad. Thats how people kill each other. Thats how people get emotionally too involved in something. They feel like its a life-or-death situation, and its not really. Its an anger situation. Theres no doubt about it. Its an anger situation. Depends on how you deal with that anger. I:\tDid anything good come from detention? R:\tWell, I learned a lot about anger management. Thats what good came out of the anger management diversion program. I:\tCould you tell me a little bit about that? R:\tWell, you just learn about a lot of peoples experiences. So, basically, yeah, you just learn a lot. You hear other peoples experiences, and a lot of them are, you know, really great stories. And a lot of individuals, what they went through, and, you know, what they tripped on, and what caused them to be angry and violent--you learn from what you hear. And you realize youre just another person that went through that sort of situation, you know. Everybody reacts emotionally different to anger-generated situations. Some people flip. Some people may kill or assault. Some people may just spew very angry things, which I did. That was my infraction. That was my wrongdoing. I was vocally violent, never physically violent; just vocally violent, you know, saying very hurtful, very mean things. Thats why I was arrested. That was the whole cause of my, you know, being taken into custody, because of the things I said. And anyway, I just learned how to defuse myself. I step away, no matter the monetary thing involved, because itd have to be a great amount of money now before Id really get pissed off about something. And I wont even probably then now, because, you know, thats happened to me once already. It wont happen again. I:\tSo, can you tell me about the day you were released? Can you walk me through it step by step? R:\tYeah, they opened the door. And I walked out, and I got my stuff and left. I:\tDid you know where you were going to go? R:\tYeah, I was going home. I:\tAnd did you meet anyone, did you see anyone? R:\tNo, I went straight home. I:\tWhat was the toughest adjustment during that time? R:\tIt was no adjustment; it was just being conscious of the restriction of the restraining order. I:\tAnd what was the first month like after your release? R:\tOh, it was very nice; just uncomfortable and awkward. I:\tIs there anything more you want to tell me about your experiences immediately after that release? R:\tNo. I:\tSo, the toughest adjustment, youre saying, would be R:\tJust getting used to the restraining order for a few months. I:\tWhat about transitional support, any support you mightve received following your release? How did you support yourself financially--job? R:\tI had a job. I:\tWhat about family? You say your sister helped with the... R:\tThat was just for the bail. I:\tThe next set of questions is about programs or services that you had access to, in general. R:\tWe already went through that. I:\tNo, these are for transitioning back to your community after release. The other ones were... R:\tOkay, go through it really fast. Im leaving after this set of questions. I:\tOkay, Im sorry. Finding a place to live? R:\tI had a place to live. I:\tSo, you didnt have access to a program... R:\tRight; I didnt have to look for a place to live. I:\tFinding a job? R:\tI had a job. I:\tFinding a means of transportation? R:\tHad transportation. I:\tContinuing your education? R:\tI had my education. I:\tFinding legal assistance? R:\tI already found my legal assistance. I:\tGetting drug or alcohol treatment? Didnt need it. Accessing healthcare, not including drug or alcohol treatment? R:\tI needed no healthcare. I:\tGetting counseling, including... R:\tJust the diversion, anger management. That was counseling. I:\tFinancial assistance? R:\tNo, I had money. I:\tObtaining photo identification? R:\tNo, everything was good there. I:\tWorking on personal relationships? R:\tNo, my personal relationships were good. I:\tAny others? R:\tNo. I:\tAre there any other programs you wish were offered post-release? R:\tNo. I:\tCan you tell me about your initial interactions with your family members after you were released? R:\tNo. I:\tThey were the same, you would say? R:\tThey understood everything I went through. They knew who I was, who I am, why I reacted the way I did. I:\tAnd what types of support did your family members provide--financial, housing, emotional, finding work, transportation, or any others? R:\tNone. I needed none of that from them; just their understanding. I:\tWhat about interactions with friends after your release, your initial reactions with them? Can you talk about that a little? R:\tYeah, just telling them what happened; thats all. Just being straightforward--this is what happened. Thats pretty much you tell your friends, heres what happened. This is who it happened with. They generally understand, because they know that individual. Even my girlfriend knew--that bitch, she turned on you. Oh, she played my girlfriend, too. She played her, too. We used to give this woman food, man. She used to come over--hey, you guys got anything to eat? Yeah, sure; what do you need? [01:28:00 inaudible] feed this woman. She hardly had any money. Thats why she was so desperate for money. I:\tWhat types of support did your friends provide? R:\tJust friendship, just understanding. I:\tEmotional, you would say? R:\tNo, Im pretty strong emotionally. I:\tAnd have you had any criminal justice contact since completing your pretrial diversion program? R:\tNegative. I:\tSo, Im going to ask you some questions about your housing situation. About how many places did you live in the first year following your most recent release? R:\tOne. I:\tAnd how would you describe it? Was that your own place, your own apartment? R:\tMy own place. I:\tAnd can you describe the pros and cons of that living situation? R:\tVery nice; I live close to work. I:\tAny cons? R:\tNo, everythings good. I:\tDo you still live in the same place? R:\tYes. I:\tSo, have you tried looking for a place to live since then, or R:\tNo, I have a place to live. I:\tSo, heres some questions about your neighborhood--how you feel about it, basically--strongly agree to strongly disagree. In my first month out, I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live. R:\tYes. I:\tAgree? R:\tYeah. I:\tIn my first month out, it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tI had no trouble in my neighborhood. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tRight. I:\tIn my first month out, I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tI wasnt worried about that. Everybodys my friend. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tDrug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tI disagree. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tYes, agree. I:\tStrongly or... R:\tYeah, strongly. I:\tI cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions. R:\tSure, agree. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who live there could get it resolved. R:\tYes, I agree. I:\tI expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYeah, strongly agree. I:\tDo you have any future goals for housing? R:\tSure; to buy a house. I:\tHow do you plan to achieve that? How do you plan to do it? R:\tA couple years from now. I:\tSave up money or whatnot? R:\tYeah, if youre going to buy a house, yeah. I:\tAnything that you want to change about your current living situation, aside from moving outside of it? R:\tNo, no, its a very nice living situation right now. I:\tAnything you want to add or talk about more related to that set of questions? R:\tNo, everythings good. We love where we live. Close to work, nice place, great rent; its all good. I was just talking to somebody about that today--wow--somebody who was looking for a place to live. I:\tIts expensive here in San Francisco. R:\tYeah, I told her what I had, where we live, the price. She goes, howd you get that? I dont know. I:\tSo, you had the same work, of course, you said, same job. R:\tYeah, never changed it. That whole situation did not affect my job in any way. I think it was only my closest friends at work that knew what happened--that I would share it with. Thats not something you want to share with people; only your closest friends [01:33:02 inaudible] the people you can trust with that sort of information. [End of recording.] END SF261    SF261\t\tPage 41  \n",
      "\t I:\tSo heres a copy for you to hang onto. And Ill hang onto this one.  [Deals with technical issues.]  I:\tSo first Im going to ask you about your background. How old are you? R:\t52. I:\tAnd your birthday? R:\tJune 26th, 64. I:\tAnd where were you born? R:\tSan Francisco. I:\tSo if you see the list, which one of these best describes your race or ethnicity? R:\tI guess white. I:\tAnd your marital status? R:\tSingle. I:\tNever married? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you have any kids? R:\tNo. I:\tWhats the highest level of education you've completed?  R:\tHigh school. Twelfth. I:\tDid you receive any help with academics? Like tutoring or special ed, or counseling, or math or reading help? R:\tMy last year I was in special ed. In high school. I:\tOnly for the last year, though? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow do you support yourself financially? R:\tSSI. I:\tAnd how much money do you earn from that? R:\tTheyre only giving me $740. I:\tPer month? R:\tPer month, yeah. Because my dad was helping me. Hes been helping me a little. So they prorated it for me, to give me less because of that. I:\tSo if you had to pick from a range for your total household income per yearand it goes from $10,000-$20,000, $20,000-$30,000   R:\tI guess itd be $10,000 to $20,000. Or maybe $10,000. Yeah, probably about $10,000.  I:\tSo now I'm going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationships with your family. So family means blood or legal relatives, or significant others and things like that. So on a scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\" what would you say to, \"I feel close to my family.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t\"I want my family to be involved in my life.\" R:\tStrongly. I:\t\"I consider myself a source of support for my family.\" R:\tUmm  whats the second  I:\tSo just agree, or neutral, or disagree, or strongly disagree? R:\tYeah, I agree. I:\t\"My family is a source of support for me.\" R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYeah. I:\t\"I fight a lot with my family members.\" R:\tNo. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tUmm  yeah. I:\t\"I often feel like I disappoint my family.\" R:\tUmm  is there an occasional? I:\tSo theres agree, neutral R:\tNeutral. Yeah. I:\t\"I'm criticized a lot by my family.\" R:\tNeutral, I guess. I:\tHow about, \"I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tHow many people do you have who would do that? R:\tIn my immediate family? Five of us, all together. Including myself. I:\tSo two parents and R:\tTwo brothers. Yeah. I:\tAnd all of them would listen to you, if you felt like you needed to talk? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow about, \"I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.\" R:\tUmm  Yeah, I agree. I:\tThe same people? R:\tYeah. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.\" R:\tYeah, strongly. Yeah. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide advice on finding a job.\" R:\tWell, Im unemployable right now. So is that   I:\tMaybe neutral? If you were able to work, and you wanted todo you have people in your family who could help with that? R:\tYeah. In that case, yeah. Yeah. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem.\" R:\tYes. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who could provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed.\" R:\tYes.  I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support.\" R:\tYes. I:\tHow many people in your family would do that R:\tUmm  I guess  I dont know. I dont know. All of them, I guess, would give me something.  I:\tIf you needed it? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs it the kind of thing that you just wouldnt ask them for that, though? R:\tYeah, pretty much. Unless I really needed it. Yeah. I:\tCan you talk a little bit about some relationships with your family that are examples of really supportive relationships? R:\tWhen I was in the hospital. I was in the hospital a couple times for a couple months at a time, and my dad came every day just about, to see me. That was pretty good. My brother, he  if he wasnt busy, hed come down and help me if I needed it; if I had a problem or something. My other brother lives across the bay, so he wouldbut its  it would be kind of hard. My mom lives way up by Sacramento, so it would be hard for her to come down. Yeah. Theyd all help me. I:\tAre there any examples of when theyve been stressful, your family? R:\tYeah. Growing up. There was stress in the house. Yeah. My parents used to fight, you know? Yeah. I heard a lot of arguing growing up.  I:\tDid they separate when you were older? R:\tYeah. I was 17. I:\tAnd you remember that there were a lot of quarrels when you were younger, before they separated. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo the next set of questions is about relationships with people outside of your family. So think of three people that youre closest to personally, like friends. It doesnt include family or a romantic partner. So how many friendsup to threedo you feel closest to? R:\t[Laugh] Up to three? Gosh. Umm  I dont know. I dont really have any close friends. Ive got acquaintances.  I:\tAnybody that you would call on for help, if you needed it? R:\tYeah. I guess. I dont know much theyd give me, but  [laugh]. I could ask them, yeah. I:\tAre there three people that are not family that you could ask for support if you needed it? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo for the third person that youre thinking of, is this person male or female? R:\tTheyre all male. I:\tAre they all white, too? R:\tIm trying to remember which three Im picking. Well  Two white and one black, I guess. I:\tSo for one of the white friends, what is his age? Do you know? R:\tAbout 55. I:\tDo you know the highest level of education he completed? R:\tHigh school. I:\tIs he working for pay? R:\tHes on SSI, too.  I:\tAnd is he married, or living with a partner? R:\tHes alone I think. I:\tAnd then for the next friend thats also white, what is his age? R:\tHes like  45, I guess. I:\tEstimates are fine. R:\tOkay. I:\tAnd the highest level of education he completed? R:\tI think high school. I:\tIs he working for pay? R:\tHe panhandles. [Laugh] Yeah. And his mother gives him money. I:\tSo hes not getting SSI or any public aid? R:\tNo. I dont think so, no. I:\tIs he married or living with a partner? R:\tNo, hes single. Lives alone. I:\tAnd then for your last friend. Hes African American. What is his age? R:\tHes 50. I think. Or 51. I:\tDo you know the highest level of education he completed? R:\tHigh school, I imagine. I:\tIs he working for pay? R:\tYeah.  I:\tDo you know if hes receiving any public aid? R:\tYeah, he gets GA. General Assistance. I:\tIs he married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. I:\tSo now Im going to ask you some questions about groups or organizations that you may be a part of that you receive any emotional or material support from. Do you belong to a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? R:\tNo. I:\tAny recreational clubs? R:\tNo. I:\tSports teams? R:\tNo. I:\tMusic or artist group? R:\tNo. I:\tNo? Crew or a gang? R:\tNo. I:\tLocal government? R:\tNo. I:\tCivic association? R:\tNo. I:\tAny other kind of support group that you access? R:\tNo. I:\tSo now Im going to ask you some questions about your employment history. How old were you when you had your first job? R:\t18. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life have you been employed? All, most, some? Little? None? R:\tUmm  From 18 to 30 I was employed most of the time. And then from 30 to 52 I pretty much recycled.  I:\tSo some, then? There is no good answer for like half. R:\tYeah. What is the choice? I:\tAll, most, some, little, or none? R:\tOh. Some. I:\tWhat kinds of things did you do when you were working? What kind of skills do you bring to the labor market? R:\tI started out, I worked at a theater. And then I was doing maintenance and snack bar, selling tickets. Things like that. And then I got a job at a gas station. Then I got a job at a 7-11. And I worked at a feed store, a warehousedriving a forklift for about a year and a-half. I did a lot of construction under the table work. Laboring, and working with contractors. That was the last thing I did, was that. Yeah. Laboring. I:\tIs there a reason that you stopped doing that work? R:\tUmm  yeah. I just started recycling because I found I could survive doing that. I moved up here to the city. I was staying in Burlingame, and I had some problems with my mom. I had a restraining order at her house. I violated that a bunch of times, and the cops were messing with me. So I just got out of town and moved up here. Then I just started recycling.  I:\tHas it been going better for you since moving up here? R:\tWell, I  No, I wouldnt say much better. I was probably doing better back then. Overall. Yeah. I:\tWhy is that? R:\tDrugs, I guess. Was my main obstacle. I:\tYou started doing more drugs when you moved here? R:\tYeah. Yeah.  I:\tIs there anything that you want to learn in the futureskills that youre looking to learn? R:\tYeah, Id like  I have interests in little things. Id like to learn how to do things. Something I could make some money at. But on SSI I think they limit you, in your income and stuff. I dont think I can have a job and keep my money. Or, theyd let me keep only so much or something.  I:\tSo if you started earning an income they would reduce that.  R:\tYeah. It kind of takes my incentive away there. I dont have any real skill. Basic. Nothing that the average person really couldnt do. Yeah. I:\tAre there other barriers to employment that youve had, other than [inaudible 19:20] drugs? Like a lack of education and training? Or transportation?  R:\tUmm  yeah, sure. If I had an education it would be a lot easier. But I still could have got a job. My leg, that messed me up. My physical disabilities. That makes it real hard to get a job. I couldnt even take a lot of jobs, with my leg and stuff. I:\tYou cant do like any heavy lifting, or walking R:\tYeah. Anything; standing, or whatever. Too long. I:\tDo you feel like employer discrimination has ever been a problem? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tCriminal record? R:\tUmm  yeah. I dont have any felonies. But Ive got some misdemeanors. What do I got? Ive got restraining order violations. From my mom, when I was younger. Possession of a burglary tool. Umm  criminal threats, they got me for. Umm  I think I got a petty theft years ago. I think they charged me, but that might have got dropped in the  I was on mental health diversion, too. Years ago. They might have dropped that charge, with the diversion I did. I:\tWould you mind talking a little bit more about your mom? Like, what was the restraining order for? R:\tWhen her and my dad split up she kicked me out of the house. And at that time I had hurt my back, and my left leg was going numb. Not numb, but I was getting zaps up and down it. My leg was buckling every other step, and just do that. And I was real nervous all the time, because it was affecting my nervous system. And it was just  I didnt have a job. I didnt have money. She kicked me out on the street just like that when I was 18. Thats all I knew. I went back to get food, and  you know, clean up or whatever I had to do. Yep. Instead of getting help when I was down I got in more trouble.  I:\tBecause she kicked you out. R:\tYeah. I:\tWas it not an option to stay with your dad at the time? R:\tNo, he was out running around, doing his thing. I dont know where he was at the time. But he knew what was going on. He never offered to help. I:\tHow about your brothers? Are they younger than you, or older? R:\tI have a twin, and a younger brother. I:\tOh, you are a twin? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Fraternal twin. I:\tWhat was he R:\tHe was around. He was still living there, at my moms. Id sleep in his truck sometimes. Hed get up in the morning to go to work and hed yell at me, Get out of here. He wasnt very supportive. I:\tBut he knew you were staying R:\tThey didnt have any free food down there. So anything I wanted, I had to steal or whatever. Go in a store and eat something. Thats how I survived. I:\tWhen you were 18? R:\tWhen I was younger, yeah. About  I was more like 20, or so. That was a bad time. My leg. If it didnt get better it would have got worse. I was ready for a wheelchair if it got any worse. Yeah. That was a bad time. I dont even like thinking about that. I:\tIm sorry. Feel free to tell me if you dont want to answer something. R:\tNo, I can talk. Im just telling you it bothers me. I dont mind telling you about it, though. I:\tOkay. Well, just keep in mind if theres ever something you dont want to think about we can move on. Thats totally fine. So where did you say was the last place you worked at? Was it where you were  R:\tLaboring. Working for a contractor. A building contractor. I:\tDo you remember when that job started? R:\tOh, gosh. Probably when I was around 25 or so. I:\tYou dont remember the year? Like 70s? 80s? R:\tOh  lets see. Thats 27 years ago. Huh. I:\tSo that would have been in the mid-90s? Was that full-time? R:\tOff and on, yeah. Sometime it was. Full and part. I:\tDo you remember how you got that job? Was it through friends? Or did you contact [inaudible 25:39]? R:\tYeah, it was through friends. I:\tDo you remember how much you earned when you were doing that job? R:\tThe last pay I was getting was $10 an hour. Or was it $15? No, it was $10 an hour. I:\tAnd what was the reason that you stopped doing that job? Was it because of your health? R:\tUmm  thats when I moved up here and started recycling. It just  It wasnt as consistent. It didnt fit into my drug lifestyle. I needed cash daily, and it was making it hard. Being on heroin, I needed cash every day. Or Id have to go to work sick. I didnt like that. So thats pretty much why I came up here and started recycling. I:\tBecause you could get cash on hand every single day.  R:\tYeah. I:\tIs there a memory of your most positive work experience that you ever had? Like, the best day of working youve ever had? It could include recycling, or R:\tThe best day  the most useful and productive. The best kind of job, or whatever? I liked working at the theater. But it wasnt really my best job. What was the question, again? I:\tYour most positive work experience ever. R:\tI guess it could be positive even though the pay aint the greatest. I liked working at the theater. Or at the 7-11. That was pretty good, too. I:\tWhat was it that made those jobs so good? R:\tI guess I was comfortable. I had a place to live. My back wasnt tweaked, messed up. I was doing better then, at the time, I guess.  I:\tHow about your most negative work experience? R:\tProbably working for this landscape company. When Id go there  I forgot to tell you about that job. I worked for [Name] in Belmont. I used to have to commute from Brisbane to Belmont every day. It was a two and a-half hour commute. Both ways, combined. And he worked the hell out of us, out in the sun. Id be half-sick sometimes, withdrawn. I didnt have money to get to work, because I was blowing all my money. I had to ride on the top of the CalTrain to get to work. I had to run out of a freight train, so Id run to [inaudible 29:07] and go get  sit next to a freight train, and as soon as the passenger train came I would dart out and get in-between two cars, climb up and jump on top. Ride on top. Jump off in Belmont. I:\tOh my gosh. R:\tEvery day. Or, about  every other day. And getting home. Id get to South City, Id get off at Millbrae. That was a bad job. I went through hell, trying to keep that. Because I couldnt take off any work because Id get fired. I already took off too much. I had to go to work, sick or not. Oh, Id be sick out there. Hard work and sick. That was awful. It was hell. I couldnt do it again. I:\tYou never got caught jumping on the train like that? R:\tNo. One time when I boarded they hesitated to go. So I knew they had seen me getting on. So I just jumped off the opposite side that everyone boarded on, and just took off. They saw me, I guess, and took off themselves. They never  yeah. And then I quit doing it after that. Or soon after. Because I quit that job. That was a nightmare, going through that. I:\tIt sounds like it. That sounds terrifying, jumping on the train.  R:\tIt wasnt that scary, really. Got the hang of it, and figured it out. All you do is  because it stops for a couple of minutes. Or a minute, at least. Thats plenty of time to dart out and climb up real quick. Then youve got this little divot at the top that you can just lay down in there. I:\tDid it go through tunnels when you were on there? R:\tNo. It might have went under a few things, but it was  nothing came close, no. Not where I was going. Its better than walking.  I:\tSo the next block of questions is about experiences you may have had with substance abuse. R:\tOh, boy. I:\tRemember that all of your responses are going to be kept private. You talked a little bit about heroin. Have you ever had a drinking or a drug problem? R:\tYeah. I:\tBoth, or just R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tHow old were you when you [inaudible 31:53]? R:\tTwelve. I:\tHave you ever received treatment for drinking or a drug problem? R:\tI went to Joe Healy detox over here once. For three days. Yeah. That helped. I got back into it  Im off it now, though. Im off alcohol, anyway. I:\tDo you still use heroin? R:\tYeah. A little bit. I:\tHave you ever been to treatment? Just the one time? R:\tYeah. Actually, I went to a heroin  I went to a detoxHelen Vine Detox in  north bay. That was like 15 years ago. I stayed there for a couple weeks. Got clean there, on the heroin. Then I started up again. Yeah. I:\tYou said you started when you were twelve? R:\tThe marijuana, yeah. Smoking weed when I was twelve. I didnt start heroin until I was 28.  I:\tWhat was the reason for the jump? Did you do things other than those two things? R:\tI tried coke a few times. Never got into it. But with my bad back, the heroin just really helped it. I:\tSo you started using heroin when you hurt your back? Is that why? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Yeah, after I hurt my back I started using it. Not right after. But when I discovered it. I tried it, and it really helped. And at the time it was like the whole thing was locked up. And then it was affecting the nerves in my leg. So I was losing muscle control. And it helped me to stretch, and  I actually did some stretching, and I got the pressure off of the nerve. Kind of like a yoga thing kept it going, kept it goingand it really helped. It got my leg turned back on one day. Just went vroom, and turned back on. Yeah, the heroin did help me. For that, anyway.  Then I had insomnia for eight months. I didnt sleep once for eight months. Not a minute, for eight months. And finally I told myself I dont care if I ever sleep again in my life. And that night I finally slept. I used to get excited. Id be going to sleep, start falling asleepand I go, Oh, boy; Im going to go to sleep tonight! And then Id get an adrenalin rush and it would wake me back up. Thats all I could think about. All day long. I cant sleep, I cant sleep. The only thing on my mind. Im glad thats over with, too. That was another bad time. Eight months. I:\tWas that drug-related? R:\tAll I did was marijuana up to that time. So  hard drugs have an effect on you like that, but  I guess I smoked enough marijuana where it switched a click in my head and put me on  I think of it like I switched onto the wake mode where I just couldnt sleep. I never had a problem since, though. I sleep great now. I go to sleep easy now. I:\tCan you talk a little bit about the effect that alcohol or drugs has had on your life? R:\tThe alcohol, not  I mean, it caused a few little problems. Nothing major. But the drugs physically destroyed me. I need a new body. Ive got scars from here down to my ankles. I had five surgeries for missing one shot; caused me to have five surgeries. I:\tOne shot of heroin? R:\tYeah. I missed the vein, and it caused an infection. It caused all kinds of problems. I had to have five surgeries.  I:\tWas that recently? R:\tA couple of years ago, yeah. It was bad. They wanted to cut my leg offmy right leg. I:\tBecause of the infection? R:\tYeah. They werent sure if they could save it. I dont know how they managed to save it. But they told me  at one point they told me that it looked like it had to go. It was almost gone, anyway. Got a lot of nerve damage. Like I was telling you, the femoral  the artery is gone, so Ive got no circulation. It gets tired fast. Yep.  I:\tSo when you were twelve and you started smoking marijuana, do you remember how you got started doing that? R:\tI found my dads stash. One day I went to go up to get some screws that he had bought at the hardware store out of a shirt pocket. And I reached in, and I pulled out the screws and there were a couple of roachesthere were some butts. I said my dad dont smoke; whats he doing with these. And I looked at them and they were green. I told my twin brother, and he said theres a whole tupperware container of that stuff under the [inaudible 38:52], I was throwing it out the window yesterday. So I go up there, and its not there. I find it in the closet, in a paper bag. On the top shelf. So thats how I first got into it.  I:\tDid your brother try it, too, then? R:\tNever touched it, my twin brother. Hes doing good. Real good. I:\tWhat does he do? R:\tElevator/escalator mechanic, technician. He runs the federal building, all by himself. Like, 20 elevators and ten escalators. He can fix anything, that guy. Hes pretty good. I:\tYou said you were kicked out of your moms house when you were 18. Did that have to do that you were smoking marijuana? R:\tNot as far as my concerned. But I guess it concerned her enough so it was probably the reason. I:\tDid she tell you as much? R:\tOh, she used to yell at me all the time for it. Youve been smoking; I smell weed or whatever.  I:\tDo you feel like you have a drug problem now? R:\tYeah. I:\tYou are using every day? R:\tYeah, but  now Im only using like 20 bucks a day. Compared to four times that much before. When I was recycling I was making like $85-$95 a day. Monday through Friday, recycling. And now there are so many people doing it I cant make that money anymore.  I:\tSo you had to use less? R:\tYeah. Yeah. The less I use, though, the less I need. You know?  I:\tSo the SSI takes care of your monthly living expenses, and then you recycle for the rest of it? R:\tYeah. My dad helps me a little. Yeah. I:\tIm going to ask you about mental and emotional health. Remember that all of your answers will be kept private. And if theres something you dont want to answer, you dont have to. R:\tOkay. I:\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professionallike a psychiatrist or a social workerthat you had a mental or emotional condition? R:\tYeah, when I was in mental health. See, that was my strategy to stay out of a year in jail for the restraining order violations. I did a drug diversiona mental health drug diversion. And I had to go to this  mental place, whatever. A mental clinic, or whatever. Every day.  They labeled me  I think it was a schizophrenic or something. But they prescribed me all these medications, like haldol, stelazine. And I wasnt taking them. Theyd give them to you every night at 8:00. But what I was doing was I was putting a little bit of denture cream under my mouth, behind my front teeth. And theyd give me the pills, and you go  and you stick them up there. Drink the water. And then you gonothing on the tongue. I got away with that for the whole year in the halfway house. I:\tIs there a reason you didnt want to take them? R:\tThose things are no good for you. They have a lot of side effects. Yeah. Theyre bad. And I quit taking them. I never did take them, you know? So they realized that. I got another doctor, and she took me off of them.  I:\tBecause you didnt want to take them? Or she said you didnt need them? R:\tSaid I didnt need them. I:\tDo you agree with the diagnosis? Do you think they were right? R:\tNo. They dont know what theyre talking about. Its totally crazy in my opinion. But where would they be without clients, right? Got to make a client. I:\tDo you think you had any condition that wasnt diagnosed? R:\tUmm  not really. I might have my strengths and weaknesses, but I dont think theyre that major. No. Ive always gotten by. I:\tHave you ever thought you might have a learning disability or a processing issue that wasnt diagnosed? R:\tI think everyone has problems, to some degree. I think Im about average. I:\tNothing different than anybody else. R:\tYeah. I:\tYou said you were in special ed when you were a senior in high school? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you remember why they put you there? R:\tYeah. My dad let them do that. They asked him. It was  Hmm. I was getting high in high school, you know? Since I was twelve. And I just wasnt into school at all. I mean, I was all right. But  I guess it was a strategy to help me graduate.  I:\tSo you didnt have difficulty with it, but you just didnt like it? R:\tI was just not into it, yeah. I didnt do my homework, ever. Or anything. I:\tYou never had teachers that you connected with, that you liked? R:\tI liked a few of them. They were all right. But that didnt change anything. I:\tDo you think that the strategy worked?  R:\tI graduated. Yeah. I graduated. I didnt like it. It was kind of embarrassing, going into Room 113. Everyone knows what that is, you know? I:\tSo it was a separate class that you went to all day? R:\tNo, just for like  one or two classes a day, Id go there. One or two periods a day.  I:\tAnd you felt like there was a stigma behind it, like everybody knew what you were there for. R:\tYeah. I:\tYou mentioned that you were prescribed medication, but you werent taking it. Have you ever taken medication for an emotional or mental health issue? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd you said you did the mental health diversion program. Were you admitted overnight for that? Or was there ever a time when you stayed overnight? R:\tA court sentenced me to a year of supervised probation, a year of living in a halfway house, two years of mental treatment, and three years of court probation. So I lived there, in a halfway house, for a year. But never in a hospital or anything. I mean, they had counselors.  I:\tDid you receive counseling from them? R:\tI mean, I talked to them a few times. I didnt really get counseled by them. I had my counselor down at the day care center. The North County Mental Health building, or whatever. Thats where I was going every day, to stay out of jail. I:\tSo it was court-ordered that you were there. R:\tYeah. Hmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tDo you feel like it was helpful? R:\tNo. Not at all. Only  It was helpful to keep me out of jail. That was it. I:\tDid it help you in terms of just keeping your life on track? R:\tNothing. A waste of time. It was a  nothing but an obstacle for me.  I:\tHow so? It was keeping you from doing things you wanted to do? R:\tKeeping me from doing anything else I wanted to do, yeah. Just a waste of time is the way I see it.  I:\tDo you think it had anything to do with your not really wanting to be there? R:\tHaving to do with what? I:\tWith it being a waste of time or it not working. R:\tWell, yeah. I didnt want to be there because its a waste of time.  I:\tDo you feel like you have an emotional or mental health condition now? R:\tNo. I:\tAll of that is in the past. R:\tI never had a condition. I:\tSo the next section is about your interactions with the police. Approximately how many times have you been arrested? R:\tUmm  probably about six times. Five times. I:\tAnd for what offenses have you been arrested? R:\tI got arrested five times alone on the restraining order. Umm  I actually got arrested for possession of heroin. Thats where I did the drug diversion. They caught me with two $20 bags. That was years ago. What else did I get arrested for? I got arrested a few other times, but they didnt arrest methey discharged me. That was for like commercial burglary, when I broke open a machine in a theater. What else? I got arrested for little warrants and stuff.  I:\tSo is theft one of them? R:\tYeah  I mean, I got charged. Yeah. For petty theft, I guess you call it. I:\tDo you remember how old you were the first time you were arrested? R:\tThe first time was the restraining order I guess. I think I was 20 or  18? I forget.  I:\t18 or 19? R:\t19? Yeah. I:\tDo you remember that event? Can you describe the arrest, from the minute you were approached by officers and taken into custody? R:\tUmm  Yeah. I mean, they caught me five different times. Im trying to remember which one was the first. I dont know. I mix them all up. They caught me with the dogs twice. Or once with the dogs. Once they caught me on the roof. And a couple times they caught me sleeping. I think the first time they woke me up and took me to jail. For sleeping. I:\tDid you know why you were being arrested? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid they read you your rights? R:\tI dont know. I dont think they did. Because they didnt question me. They just ORd me. I:\tSo they just took you in R:\tThey ORd me like four times. The last time they took me to the Redwood City jail, and thats when I bailed out. I:\tDid they give you access to a lawyer? R:\tA public lawyer. And I fired him and got a paid lawyer. I:\tSo you fired the public defender and hired a lawyer? R:\tYeah. My dad helped me do that. I:\tDid that work out better? R:\tIt got me what it got me, instead of jail. Three years of court probation, two years of mental health treatment, a year in a halfway house, and a year of supervised. I guess you could say thats better. I dont know. I actually got kicked out after a year. And I went back to court, facing all the charges all over again. They gave me ten days on the sheriffs work program. I:\tWhy [inaudible 54:54]? R:\tI think I was smoking marijuana in the backyard. I:\tOf your moms house? R:\tNo, the halfway house. And they smelled it or something. I dont know. I:\tDo you know how many times youve been convicted? R:\tUmm  well, these diversion cases dont go down as convictions, huh? I:\tRight. R:\tOkay. So  gosh. I dont even know. A couple of times I guess? I:\tDo you know for what youve been convicted? R:\tI dont know if it went on the drug diversion, or if that got thrown out or not. All my little cases. I think they consolidated them and threw them out. Im sure Ive got something they didnt. Im not sure. I:\tI can put unsure. Do you remember how old you were at the first time of your first conviction? R:\t18 or 20? Its so long ago. I:\tSo youre not really sure what you were actually convicted of, back then. R:\tNo felonies. I dont have any felony convictions. I:\tRight. R:\tAnd I got the drug diversion for the restraining orders. And  Okay, I do have a conviction for criminal threats. That one was about three years ago, four years ago. I:\tIs that the most recent? R:\tYeah. I got convicted for that. I:\tDo you remember what was happening at the time? R:\tOh, I was just leaving some calls. Some nasty calls. I told someone I prayed they died, or something. Gave him a text, I pray you die, or something like that. Just some personal  argument. I:\tDid you mean it? R:\tNo, I didnt mean it. No. I didnt actually pray that they died, no. I wanted them to think that at the time.  I:\tAnd that person called the police? R:\tI went to visit them in the hospital, and thats when they called the police on me. I:\tSo you had made the threats via text, and then you went to visit them in the hospitaland the hospital called the R:\tThe hospital had their own police. The sheriff is right on duty. What happened is I went in there to visit  my friend went in there to visit. They said they werent having any visitors at that time. So I left. My friend went in there, and he caused a problem. So then the police came up. And then she tells him about the phone calls; tells the cop about the phone calls. So they arrested me, and charged me with criminal threats or whatever. Criminal threats. They gave me about five meetings I had to go to. That was my sentence. I:\tYou [inaudible 59:07] for that? R:\tNo. I just had to do a few classes. And that was it. I:\tSo the next set of questions is about your experience with incarceration or probation, or parole. Did you ever go to juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tYou were 19 when you first went to jail? R:\tApproximately, yeah. I:\tDo you remember approximately how many times youve been in jail?  R:\tAbout five. No, no. Wait. Yeah, about five. I:\tDo you know how long you served total in jail?  R:\tUmm  I did six days was the longest stretch I ever did. So six, four  and a couple of day and a-halfers. Something like that. I:\tSo like 15 days total? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd youve never been to prison? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd how old were you the first time you were on probation or parole? Was that 19, also? R:\tYeah.  I:\tAnd do you know how many months you had to do that for? R:\tIt was three years. I:\tTotal? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIm going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about legal authorities. So it goes from strongly agree to strongly disagree. I feel like I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tPeople should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tNo.  I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tIt is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tNot really. Totally disagree. I:\tThe law represents the values of the people in power rather than the values of people like me. R:\tYeah.  I:\tStrongly agree or somewhat agree? R:\tStrongly. I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tThats what theyre for. Yeah. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tDisagree.  I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tI dont know. I:\tThere is a neither agree nor disagree if you want. R:\tOkay. I:\tThat one? R:\tYeah. I:\tMost police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tNo. I dont know.  I:\tSo neither agree nor disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tThe basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police. R:\tYeah. I:\tStrongly agree, or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tPolice in my city have too much power. R:\tUmm  I agree.  I:\tMost police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tYeah, Im sure it happens. Most? I dont know. Cant say.  I:\tSo neither agree nor disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tYouve never seen it happen where you feel like  R:\tYeah, I mean Ive seen it both ways; respect and no respect. But I dont know to what proportion in either case. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, or questioned by the police? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow many times do you think that has happened during your lifetime? R:\tOh, god; probably about  hmm  six times? Seven? Ten times, probably. I:\tDo you remember the last time it happened? R:\tHmm. Umm  Not really. They just pull up, and they, Hey, what are you doing, and all that. Nothing. Those cases. I dont remember when it happened. I guess a year ago or so. I:\tLike youre just walking around not doing anything, and they come up and hassle you? R:\tYeah. You could be standing somewhere, and theyll just  I dont know. I forget. I:\tDo you feel like race has shaped your experience with the police at all? R:\tRace as an issue? I dont know. There are probably prejudiced cops out there. I dont know. I:\tYou just havent really encountered it? R:\tYeah. I havent had a problem with it, really. That I noticed. I:\tSo the next set of questions are about the arrest that led to your most recent pretrial detention experienceso the time that you spent in jail waiting for a decision on your case. Do you remember the circumstances to that arrestthe arrest that you participated R:\tYes. I was riding my bicycle in Bayshore. And this cop  I was riding down the sidewalk, going the opposite direction of traffic. But Im on the sidewalk. The cop comes by, jumps the curb, cuts me off. Jumps out. Starts asking me what I got. And he starts reaching into my pockets, and found the shit. I didnt give him permission to search me or anything. He took me to jail. I:\tDo you remember if they read you your rights during that time? R:\tI dont think so. I dont know. They dont have to, do they? I:\tI think typically they do, yeah. R:\tI thought it was just if they interrogate you; they need to read you your rights before they interrogate you. Otherwise  it dont matter, I thought. I dont know. I:\tIs this when your dad helped you hire a lawyer? Or were you assigned a public defender for this case? R:\tI got a public defender for that.  I:\tAnd theyre the one that helped you. R:\tYeah, a woman public defender. Yeah.  I:\tDo you remember how long you were held in detention that time? R:\tSix days. I:\tCould you tell me about the experience? R:\tWait a minute. I take that back. I was ORd on that. Wait a minute. How many days did I spend  Im losing my memory. Its been so long ago. I think I got ORd in a couple of days. I:\tSo it was only like two days for that? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat was it like being held that time? R:\tWhat was it like in jail? Lousy. Pretty miserable. I mean, you know, Im not used to sitting there all day. I was always running all day long, with a shopping cart. Sit in jail, you get stuck like that. No entertainment. Nothing. Yeah, it was boring.  I:\tWere you in there with a lot of other people? Or were you in a cell kind of by yourself? R:\tI was in the  I never got housed up with the  upstairs, with the crowd. With the dorms. I was in this like F-Pod, where theyve got four man cells. But theyre open. In the middle theres a  you know, where the guard or whatever stays. And all the desks, and all that. And its all just glass all around it. There are just open cells all the way around it. Hmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tDo you remember how you were treated by the guards there? R:\tOkay. Didnt have any problem. I:\tDid you talk to your family during that time? R:\tI think I might have made a quick call to one of them. My dad. Or  I think I made a call to my dad to let him know. I:\tHe didnt come to visit you or anything? R:\tNo. Like I said, I think I was only in there for a day and a-half or two days. And they ORd me. I:\tWere there any programs or services while you were there? Like mental health, medical, dental? Anything like that? R:\tThey had methadone in there.  I:\tDid you use it? R:\tYou know, I cant remember if I did or not that time. Ive only been in there, in Redwood CityI mean, in San Francisco mail a couple of times. And I did have methadone once. I dont know if it was that time or what. I:\tDoes methadone work the same way? Like, is it a good proxy? Or is it kind of like  R:\tIts all right. Its a lot harder to quit, though. Than heroin. Much more difficult to quit, to stop. If you need to stop. Yeah. I:\tWere there any services there that you wish they had offered, but they didnt? R:\tHmm. I wish they had all kinds of good stuff. [Laugh] I dont know. Not that I can think of, that Id ask. I:\tHow did your dad react? Was it just kind of  R:\tUmm  I dont know.  I:\tDo you remember how he reacted? R:\tIm sure he wasnt happy. Like normal. I:\tDid you keep in contact with your family every time that youve been Have you found it easy to stay in contact with your family? R:\tWhen Ive been in jail? Yeah. I never had them visit me, because I was never there that long. But I made a few phone calls. I think my fathers number is the only one I can make a collect call to, though. All the other ones wouldnt accept. Because they were already pre-arranged where it wouldnt even go through. They wont even ask them. I:\tSo this last time you were in there you said you were ORd. Was that before they decided what they were going to do? R:\tYeah. And then I went to court and they gave me  This last timeyeah, and then they gave me those classes. I:\tDid you have to pay anything for your release? R:\tOh, I think they waived the $20 fee or something like that.  I:\tBecause of low-income status? R:\tI guess. Yeah. I:\tDid they tell you anything when [inaudible 74:59] you were going to be released? Did they give you any  was it a formal process? R:\tGetting released from jail? Yeah. It takes about as much time to get out as it does to get in. Its a process. You lay around in a room. They do all your fingerprints. And you go back. And then they transfer you to another cell, and another cell. It takes a while to check in and to check out. Two hours, minimal, Id say. I:\tDid they provide you with any resources or anything when you checked out? R:\tNo. I:\tDid you find it difficult to meet the requirements of going to court and going through the process to find out they were going to do diversion with you? R:\tIt wasnt  no, it wasnt that difficult. I:\tWas it just the one court date that you went to? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd at that point they said that they were going to R:\tYeah, they gave me the classes. Yeah. I:\tWere there any negative consequences that happened as a result of your being held in jail? Like, losing your housing or property, or debt, or anything like that? R:\tNo. I:\tWas your experience different than what you expected it would be? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you feel like anything good came from being held in jail? R:\tNo. Well, I guess it taught me I didnt want to go back. I:\tI guess thats a good thing. So this next section is about risk and needs assessment. Usually theres a process by which you are assessed for a diversion program that you participate in. Do you remember any kind of  do you remember told that you were being considered for pretrial diversion? R:\tYeah. I think my  my lawyer told me. I:\tDo you remember it being a choice, or just like here is whats going to happen kind of thing. R:\tYeah, it was kind of like that. I:\tOr did they lay out either you can do diversion or you can  R:\tThey didnt really  oh, yeah; I could have faced the charges or done the diversion. And erase the conviction. Thats why I went with that. I:\tDo you remember them doing an interview with you to talk about your eligibility for participation? R:\tThey just came right into the court. Right into the holding thing, and told me. I:\tDo you remember them ever giving R:\tWait a minute. Yeah, thats right. Im sorry. I:\tNo worries. It was a long time ago. Just interrupt me, its no problem.  R:\tOkay. I:\tDo you remember them giving you a level of risk? Like, a risk of reoffending? Do you remember that process at all? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tDid they make an assessment about your needs at the time? Nothing like that? R:\tIn the court? The lawyer? I:\tYeah. R:\tNo. I:\tDid you feel like the program would help you reduce your odds of reoffending at all? R:\tUmm  I guess.  I:\tLike some? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat made you feel that way? R:\tI didnt want to have to go through all that crap again. I:\tSo just because there was the hassle.  R:\tYeah. Right. I dont have any reason at the time to do it, anyway right now. At the time I was having some  things werent going right.  I:\tHow do you mean? R:\tJust people werent treating me right. I:\tPeople like your family or your friends? R:\tFriends. Got me arguing with them. And when they wouldnt answer the phone  thats how I make them answer. You piss them off, so they call you back.  I:\tThat works? R:\tSometimes. I:\tDo you remember how much it cost you to participate in the program? R:\tNo. I dont think it cost anything. I:\tDo you know if it was waived or reduced because of low-income? R:\tI think it was waived. I:\tYou mentioned you had to do some classes. What were other things that they asked you to do? R:\tThats it. I:\tYou didnt have to check in with somebody weekly, or anything like that? R:\tJust twice a week go to my classes. Two one-hour classes a week for a couple of weeks. Two and a-half weeks or something. It was only like five visits. I:\tWhat kinds of things did the program do to address your needs? Do you feel like it addressed your needs at all? R:\tI guess. Just talked  I cant remember exactly what it was. They just talked about everyones little personal situations and stuff. Mostly just listened to everyone else. When you sit in a big group you spend most of the time everyone else talks. Everyone gets a turn to talk, so most of the time youre just listening to peoples stories. I:\tDo you feel like that was helpful for you? R:\tNo. I dont know. Just staying out of jail. I:\tJust helpful to the extent that it kept [inaudible 82:21] your record. R:\tIt might have got me to think about things a little. But I dont know  what I could say it actually has done for me. Hard to call that one. I:\tWhat kind of things did it make you think about? R:\tJust everyones cases and stuff. Situations. Just life in general. Nothing I havent seen before. Just made you focus on different things more. Realize that theres a way out, other than losing your temper or whatever. You know? Thats what its all aboutjust controlling yourself. Thats all. Thats all I got out of that. If that. I:\tSo youre not really sure  they didnt give you any strategies for keeping your temper or anything? R:\tNothing I can think of. Must not have made that much of an impression for me to remember. Im an adult. What are you going to teach me in a couple of hours, talking to a bunch of people? I:\tIs there any one story in particular that anybody had that made you really stop and thinkwow.  R:\tI mean, it was beneficial. Thinking back. Its been so long, you know? I like the way you go there, you sign in. Sometimes they let you go early. I think towards the end is when everyone talked. I guess he talks first, and then everyone else talks after. Ill be honest with you, there were a lot of people in there that needed to be there, though. Just going into that class I felt  like I almost had to fight a few idiots, you know what I mean? Just some real assholes, some real jerks. I dont start trouble. Never started trouble. People just come on me. Have some kind of attitude or something with you for no reason at all.  I:\tDid you ever get into a fight with anybody that was there? R:\tNo.  I:\tJust felt like they were being assholes for no R:\tYeah. Some people. Not the people that worked there. Just the other clients. I:\tLike what kind of stuff were they doing? R:\tI dont know. Bump into you or something, and then tell you to get out of their way or some shit. Just rude. Disrespectful nonsense.  I:\tWere there any other people in those classes that you got to know as a result of participating? R:\tNo. I mean  I was friendly with a few of them. There were some decent ones in there, but I didnt stay in touch with them or anything. I:\tHow about staff people? Were there any staff people that you met there that you connected with? R:\tYeah, they were okay. We had a black guy; he was a nice guy. Thats about all I can say. I:\tNobody that made a profound difference. R:\tNo. I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tInconvenient. But not really difficult. I:\tJust getting there every other day or R:\tJust wasting my time being there, I guess was the only inconvenience. I:\tWere you ever accused of violating the program requirements? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you remember what you were told when you were getting close to finishing the program? Like, what you would have to do to have your record cleared? R:\tNo. I just had to complete my five days or whatever it was, and Im done. You get it signed off and give it to the office.  I:\tAnd then once you submitted that to the office, then they were likeyoure done; youre free to go. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd they told you your charges were dropped? R:\tYeah. The charge was dropped. It was one charge I think. I:\tSo to what extent do you agree with the following? Overall, the program was very helpful. So, strongly agree to strongly disagree. R:\tEither I strongly agree or strongly disagree? I:\tOr anywhere in-between.  R:\tI somewhat agree that its helpful. I:\tWhat do you think was particularly helpful about it? R:\tJust focusing on everything and paying attention. Thinking about it. Bringing it  making an issue of it. Not forgetting about it. Thinking about it. I:\tKind of like forcing you to deal with it? Or  R:\tUmm  yeah. Basically. I:\tWould you recommend the program to others? R:\tYeah. Yeah. I mean, usually  Im not going to get anything out of anything like that. Really, its not me. But it wasnt that bad, when you really think about it. I:\tSo in terms of getting the charge off your record it was helpful. But in terms of making a difference in your life in a positive way, its kind of likeeh, not really? R:\tUmm  somewhat. I:\tDo you think there are any issues that the program could address, in terms of how it treats its clients? R:\tI dont have any problem with that. But the clients need to treat the other clients with respect. That was the only disrespect Ive seen. I:\tDo you think that would be better if you were meeting in smaller groups or something, so that there was less  conflict amongst the other clients? R:\tNo. There wasnt that much conflict. Just a couple of occasions  a couple of little words with a few other clients. It wasnt that bad. But I could tell theres a reason why theyre there. I:\tDo you feel like the program prepared you to deal with any challenges after it ended? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tWhat particularly? What tools do you think it gave you? R:\tJust think about the consequences of things. Think about another persons frame of mind. What their situation is. I dont know. I:\tIt helped give you some perspective? R:\tYeah. A little bit. Got me to think about a few little things. I:\tSo this next set of questions is about some of your most immediate experiences after your release. Can you tell me about the day that you were released? R:\tThe day I was released? You mean the day I completed the program? Just like any other day.  I:\tNothing different? You just kind of went on about your life? R:\tYeah. I:\tIm going to ask you about some forms of assistance that you may have received. Did you get any  how did you support yourself financially? Were you doing SSI at the time? R:\tNo, I just got that a couple of years ago. I was recycling at that time. I:\tDid you have access to any kind of programs that would help you with finding a place to live? R:\tNo. Not that I  I mean, Im sure theyre out there. I guess. I dont know. I:\tThey didnt offer anything like that? R:\tIve had shelter people come by and tell you about  yeah, Ive had access to all of that. I just never  never checked anything out. I:\tHow about for finding a job? R:\tNo. I:\tFinding a means of transportation? R:\tNo, I already had that. The bus. I:\tContinuing your education, if you had wanted to do that? Did you have access to a program that would help with that? R:\tI dont know. Im sure theyre out there, though. I:\tFinding legal assistance? R:\tIve been in the homeless coalition before.  I:\tDo they provide legal assistance? R:\tYeah. Like, they were clearing up petty tickets. You go in there with a ticket and they clear it up. I got a couple of them signed, and I got sick when I was supposed to take them into courtso I never turned them in. I probably got warrants for those now. I:\tBut the homeless coalition was helping you with that? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid you find that helpful? R:\tYeah. I:\tHave you had access to getting drug or alcohol treatment since your last release? R:\tUmm  yeah, Ive had access to it. I didnt pursue it. I:\tHow about health care, not including drug or alcohol treatment? R:\tYeah. I got on Medicare or  what do you call it? Medi-Cal.  I:\tDo you find that helpful? R:\tUmm  I havent noticed, really. I guess. It got me a free cellphone for having a Medi-Cal card. I:\tReally? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnybody who has Medi-Cal can get that? R:\tYeah. I think so. I:\tIs it like a full-service plan and everything? They pay the monthly bill? R:\tYeah. For about a year. And then youve got to renew it.  I:\tHow about getting counseling, including mental health [inaudible 95:48]? R:\tCounseling? I havent had really any offers on any of that, no. I:\tHow about getting financial assistance? R:\tI took care of that already. I:\tObtaining photo identification? R:\tI got that. I:\tWas there a program that helped you? R:\tI got a voucher from the [Inaudible 96:06] Street Drop-In. They gave me a $17 voucher, so I only had to pay like $8. I:\tTo get a photo ID? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow about any programs for working on personal relationships? R:\tNo. I:\tAre there any programs that you wish were offered, that you havent had access to? R:\tUmm  I guess  Yeah, maybe something to find housing. Because Id like to find a better hotel than where Im at right now. And Im paying $725 a month. I hear people spending only a third of their income, a third of their checka third of their GA, a third of their SSI. And I dont know how they do it. But Im giving up my whole check. I:\tJust for housing. R:\tYeah. Thats why my dad has been helping me. I wish they had some more help with cheap housing. I guess everyone wants that. Yeah. I think the problem is theyre giving all these hotels away to these homeless people for nothing or their cheap rent. And thats putting everyone else out, with money. I dont know exactly. But its not fair for someone thats  you know? Only $200 a month and Im paying $725. Or whatever. I:\tIn general, how would you say your detention has affected your relationship to your family members? Has it changed a lot? R:\tWhat detention? I:\tAny times that youve been in jail for. R:\tIt hasnt been long enough to have any real effect. I:\tSo not much change. R:\tNo. I:\tYou mentioned that your dad provides some financial support. What other kinds of supports do your family members offer? Housing? Emotional? Finding work? Transportation? Anything like that? R:\tNo. I:\tHas your detention affected your relationship with friends at all? R:\tNo.  I:\tDo you have any friends that provide any kind of support? Like financial, housing, emotional support? None of that? R:\tNo. I:\tIm going to ask you a little bit more about your housing situation. So following your most recent release how many places did you live in for the first year? Have you moved around a lot? R:\tFollowing  what are you asking me? I:\tSo, since the last time that you were released from jail and then you participated in diversion, how many different places have you lived since then? R:\tOh. Well, I only did live in a couple places. I think that other one was a long time ago. Just where Im at now, I guess, since then. I:\tOkay. And youre in a hotel? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd youve been in the hotel for a long time? R:\tYeah, a couple of years. I:\tWhere were you before that? R:\tHomeless. I:\tYou were just sleeping on the streets? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid you do that for a long time? R:\tYeah. Basically since I was  since the restraining orders. Since I was 18, 19 or whatever it was. Ive only been housed a few years in-between then. In the last 30 years Ive been homeless probably 25 of them. I:\tHow did you end up getting into the hotel that youre in? R:\tMy dad helped me. He got it for me. I:\tBecause he knew you were sleeping on the streets. R:\tYeah. I:\tHelped you get hooked up with that. R:\tYeah. I:\tCan you describe the pros and cons of your living situation? R:\tI got electricity, and a toilet and all that. The cons? It cost a lot of money.  I:\tIs it enough to make it worth it? You would never go back to sleeping on the streets? R:\tUmm  Yeah, its kind of  its like it is just barely better. Just over the edge of making it worth it. If it was any worse Id be out on the street. Put it that way. I:\tIs it just having electricity and a toilet are the things that make it worth it? R:\tA roof. Electricity. Shelter. A place to leave my stuff where no one steals it. A safe place to sleep. But they got bedbugs. They got cockroaches. They have plugged up toilets all the time. I mean, the place is kind of disgusting. Sometimes Id be happier on the street. I:\tDo you feel like youve ever had trouble finding a place because of your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tNo. I:\tThat hasnt really been a barrier for you at all? R:\tNo. Not misdemeanors. I:\tIm going to read some statements to you about your feelings towards your neighborhoodboth immediately following the last time you were in jail and then today. So these are the ones that are immediately following the last time. So, from strongly agree to strongly disagree, what would you say to, In my first month out I felt like my neighborhood was a safe place to live. R:\tWhat are the choices? I:\tStrongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree. R:\tI agree. I:\tIt was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tI disagree. I:\tI was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tNot really. Disagree. I:\tDrug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tYeah, theres a lot of drug dealers around here. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYeah. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI cared what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tI agree. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who lived there can get it resolved. R:\tPossibly.  I:\tAgree? R:\tWhats the middle one? I:\tNeither agree nor disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tI expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tHmm. I agree. I hate to say it. I:\tSo these ones are about your neighborhood today. So, My neighborhood is a safe place to live. R:\tI agree. I:\tIt is hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tSomewhat. I:\tI am nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tDisagree. I:\tDrug selling is a major problem in the neighborhood. R:\tI agree. I:\tI think my neighborhood is a good place to live. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI care about what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tI agree. I:\tIf there is a problem in my neighborhood, people who live here can get it solved. R:\tThe middle one again.  I:\tI expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tYeah. I:\tYou really like being in the Bay Area, even though its so expensive? R:\tYeah. I cant see myself moving out of here, out of this area. Its all I know. You know? I:\tSo long term you plan to stay here. R:\tYeah. I:\tAre you planning on staying in the hotel long-term? Or do you have different goals? R:\tHopefully not. But possibly. I:\tWhat do you hope to do instead? R:\tGet an apartment or something. A studio. Something. Somewhere where Ive got my bathroom and my shower inside my room. I dont have to share it with the hotel. I:\tSo the last time you were released you didnt have a job, other than recycling? R:\tRight. I:\tDid you search for work at all? R:\tNo. I:\tIs that mostly for health reasons, or what were the reasons that you werent looking for work? R:\tUmm  I dont know. It would probably be tough for me to get a job with my history, you know? My work history. What kind of resume would I have? Not a very good one. I kind of gave up. But now I cant work, anyway. Because of my legs. I:\tBut before that  there was a period of time where you were just recycling and you didnt have SSI yet? Was it just because there was no point in searching for work? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you think your criminal record had anything to do with it? R:\tNot much. I:\tBecause theyre mostly misdemeanors? Or just because  R:\tYeah. Pretty petty stuff. A long time ago, mostly. I:\tDo you have any goals in terms of employment over the next year or five years? Or are you kind of satisfied with what youre doing now? R:\tYeah. I cant think of anything. I:\tDid you have any debt related to your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tNo, I:\tSo in general, how would you say that your criminal justice obligations have affected your life?  R:\tUmm  made it much more difficult. Especially when I was younger, when I had a car. I wasnt making much money, working at the theater and at that 7-11. I was giving the courts all my money for tickets. Little tickets, you know? I wouldnt have the money to  they were sucking the blood out of me. Yeah. I just liked being left alone when it comes to  little things like that.  I:\tParking tickets and things? R:\tA moving violation or something. I wouldnt have the money, and then they  it just gets hard. They go up and  I dont know. It wasnt easy. Because I didnt have money to begin with. And theyre taking every little bit I got, you know? I:\tIt was just like a compounding thing? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs there anything else thats going on in your life that we havent talked about, that you feel like is important? R:\tNo, not really. I dont know. I told you Ive been sick. I dont know whats wrong with me. I get sick for no reasons. My stomach. I never was like that before. Since my last hospital stay Ive been having problems with my stomach and throwing up. I dont know. I:\tYour last hospital stay that was because you missed the vein? R:\tYeah. I:\tHave you been to the doctor for that?  R:\tYeah. They cut me from here to my ankles. I:\tNo, I mean recently. R:\tOh, recently about that? No. Im scared to go in there. I am.  I:\tBecause you dont know what theyre going to say? R:\tYeah. And getting all those tests, and this, and that. Oh, god. Its the worst thing in the world, going through a bunch of surgeries. I dont like hospitals. I just want to feel better. I feel okay now. I just  Im watching my diet and stuff, and seeing if I can get a clue if thats doing something to me. I dont know, though. I cant pinpoint anything. I just keep checking and seeing what I can find out. I:\tYour diet hasnt changed at all? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tHave your drug habits changed? Maybe that R:\tNot really. Im not withdraw sick. Its something else. Something to do with my overall health, you know? My organs or something I think. Im not sure. I was on dialysis for a couple of weeks. I told you that? I:\tNo. R:\tYeah. That was during the surgery; in-between the surgeries. When they took the  they had to take that pipe out of my leg. It was infected. The artificial one. And my kidneys  and my potassium was real high. So they gave me some dialysis. And it got good enough to where they could release me without the dialysis. So that was good. They gave me a special diet. They told me not to eat bananas, oranges and potatoes. Stay away from them. Ive actually eaten potatoes and havent gotten sick. And oranges and stuff. So I dont know whats going on with me right now. I:\tYoull have to go back in and ask them. R:\tYeah, youre right. I:\tIt sucks, though. R:\tI know. Take all day. Oh, well. It might not be too bad. I dont know. But they cant get blood out of me. I dont have any veins. Its so difficult. Theyve got to get a PICC line in me and all that stuff. Just a real  just a nightmare. I:\tDo you have any questions for me at all? R:\tNot really.  I:\tAll right. Well, some of the things that we talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable topics. Was there anything that you thought was particularly uncomfortable to talk about? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tDo you have any suggestions for how we could ask any of our questions more effectively? R:\tNo, you did all right. You did good. I:\tGood. In case we ever need to get in touch with you in the future would you be willing to give us names and contact info for any family members? R:\tYeah. This is all confidential, right? I:\tYeah. R:\tYeah, I dont care.  I:\tWho would R:\tI guess my brother, my twin brother. I:\tWhats his name? R:\t[Tells name.] [They joke about the rhyming names of the twins.]  R:\tI dont know what they were thinking.  [Laughter]  I:\tDid you ever ask your mom why she did that? R:\tYeah. She said she liked the name [explains the names]. I:\tThats funny. R:\tI asked my dad the other day, in fact. Coincidence. I:\t[Asks for phone number and address, and he gives the information.]  So those are all the questions I have for you. This is a thank you for participating. R:\tThank you. I:\tI need your signature that you received it. R:\tAll right. [Signs the paperwork.] Okay. I:\tThats it. R:\tThanks a lot, Rebecca. I:\tThank you. It was nice to meet you.

      " [Chatting]  I:\tIm going to ask you several sets of questions that have to do with your background, your relationships, and then your experiences before, during, and after criminal justice contact. So Im going to start by asking about your background. So, how old are you? R:\t34. I:\tAnd when were you born? R:\tJuly 26th, 1982. I:\tAll right, where were you born? What city? R:\tWatsonville, California. Santa Cruz County. I:\tAre you a U.S. citizen? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd whats your gender? R:\tMale. Last time I checked. I:\tSo could you choose this list a category or categories that best describe how you identify in terms of race or ethnicity? So, white, black, Hispanic, Latino/Chicano, Asian, Native American-- R:\tYeah, white. I:\tAll right. And then could you tell me how you think youre perceived by others in terms of race or ethnicity?  R:\tWhite. I:\tAll right. Lets see. So, whats your present marital status? Married, separated, divorced, widowed, single/never married, living with a partner. R:\tLiving with a partner. I:\tHave you been married before? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you have any children? R:\tNope. I:\tAll right. Whats the highest level of education completed? So, some-- R:\tUmm  two years college. I:\tOkay, so some college. All right. Did you receive any help in school with academics, ever? So, ever any tutoring? Extra reading help, extra math help, special ed classes, anything like that? R:\tNope. I:\tAll right. So how do you support yourself financially right now? So, no support? Job or jobs? Support from family? Support from friends? Government programs? Child support? Well, you said you dont have kids. Illegal income? Other forms of-- R:\tYou said illegal income? I:\tYeah. R:\tOh, no, I dont have that. Right now I run a boat restoration shop. I:\tOkay, so job. Just one job? R:\tSure. I:\tOkay. Any government programs, support from family, support from friends, any other  R:\tNope. I:\tAll right. So how much do you earn? And that could be by day, week, month--whatever makes sense. R:\tIt varies. I mean, it goes by  I mean, I restore old racing sailboats, so it really varies. But this is my first year doing it, so I wouldnt even begin to know. I:\tOkay. Whats like  like, how much did you make, would you say, last month?  R:\tMmm, I would say if you wanted me to give you an annual, I would say its probably like $40K to $50k. I:\tA year, okay.  R:\tThats taking a  a low end average, I would imagine. I:\tOkay. Okay, so then for your total household income, you said youd be between $40,000 and $50,000 you would estimate? R:\tUmm  well thats my end. For my fianc, it would be, umm  she makes another $40,000; $38,000-$40,000. I:\tOkay. So then if you were looking at this bracket for total household income it would be-- R:\tYeah, $70,000 to $80,000. I:\tOkay, so now Im going to read you some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationships with your family. In this case, by family it means blood or legal relatives, significant others, or guardians that youve lived with. So Ill read the statements, and then your choices are strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree, not applicable. So, I feel close to my family. R:\tMmm  in the middle. I forgot whatever the middle one was. I:\tSo, neutral? R:\tYeah. I:\tAll right. I want my family to be involved in my life. R:\tMmm, strongly agree. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. Family is a source of support for me. R:\t[Laugh] N/A, or whatever the lowest one would be. I:\tSo, strongly disagree? R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tOkay. Is there a particular reason? You seemed to like, laugh and think of something. R:\tNo. Its just that I come from a  kind of a shitty family dynamic. And so Ive spent a lot of time trying to help people out, but it was all seemingly one  there was no reciprocity to it.  I:\tOkay. And you mean that in terms of like financial support, emotional support  both? R:\tYeah. C; all of the above, yeah. I:\tOkay. So another statement. I fight a lot with my family members. R:\tNo. Strongly disagree. I:\tI often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tIm criticized a lot by my family. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. Are there particular issues or reasons why that  you feel that way? R:\tMmm  no. I mean, without going too far in depth into it, Id say well, I guess the gist of it is I have a mother who is in an abusive relationship with a man. And Ive tried to help her out and be supporting--ranging from just, you know, support, to, you know, getting her out of the situation. And it ended with me, you know, just getting basically shat on, you know? And so I was kind of like, Hmm, okay, well, no problem, so.  I:\tOkay. Does that cause tension between other family members in your family as well? R:\tNo, my familys pretty, kind of, umm  you know, satellite. Theyre not really communicative with one another.  I:\tOkay. Is your mothers abusive partner; is that your father or someone else? R:\tMy stepfather. I:\tStepfather. How long has that been going on for? R:\tUmm  on and off for about six, seven years. I:\tHow does that  I mean, obviously, thats an intense and traumatic, and stressful situation. How does that affect you, like how does that make you feel? R:\tUmm  now not so much, aside from just, you know, general disdain for anything their direction. But, umm, for a while--for about a year--it was a struggle. Because I was trying to help her out. My fiance and I were both trying to help her out, and  umm, you know, its just pretty classical, you know? Abuse system where, you know, she doesnt want to be with him, wants to get out of the situation--but when presented with the opportunities too, she stays in it. So its one of those things where I myself had to basically resign to, Nothing I can do. Not my program, not my life. I:\tThank you for sharing. [Inaudible 7:23] there. So Ive got some more statements, and then your answer options are the same. I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk. R:\tUmm  blood relatives, no. I:\tAnd that can include significant others that you live with. R:\tOh, yeah. Yeah, my fiance and I are pretty--you know, were like, best friends kind of thing. I:\tOkay, so do you agree, then? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs she the only person? R:\tStrongly agree, yeah.  I:\tOkay. So just one? R:\tI have other people that are more, you know, a friend. I:\tRight, but if were just thinking about family that includes-- R:\tFor immediate families, yeah. Just one. I:\tOkay. I have someone in my family to turn to for advice on how to deal with a personal problem. R:\tSame person, yeah. I:\tAll right. I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tSay it again? I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tNo. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job. R:\tNo. No, I mean, linked to this one, I mean, I was homeless in San Francisco for about a year. Umm  year and some change, while working. Both my fiance and I. She worked for the school district. And I was working, doing terrazzo and mosaic work. Its like Italian stone masonry. And Im sure I need not tell you, you know, the price of San Francisco is just so ridiculous. And so we lost our housing. We were looking around at some other options. So we ended up basically homeless for a year and some change. So, as related to that prior question, I think  I:\tSo you didnt have anyone you could turn to at that point? R:\tNo. I:\tWhen was that, how long ago was that? R:\tMmm  two years ago? Two and a-half, three years? Well, about three years, ago, yeah. I:\tHow--where did you end up staying? Were you couch-surfing? Were you in hotels, what was the  R:\tUmm, well that actually bought a  you know, took all of our shit, threw away what we didnt need. Umm  bought a van. Lived in a van for a year. It was pretty shitty and rough, you know? Working--every day I worked in construction, and she worked, you know, in a not easy field also. And, you know, it wasnt that we didnt have money. It was just everywhere wed go, wed get outbid for places or shit like that. The typical stuff here about San Francisco.  I:\tAnd thats a long stretch of time to be living out of a van. R:\tYeah. Yeah, it sucked, yeah. I:\tYeah. What would you say was the most challenging part of that? I mean Im sure there were a lot of challenges, but-- R:\tYeah, oh yeah. Thats pretty easy to answer. The, umm  I would say it was, umm  just the fact that like, everybody, you know, is [inaudible 10:13] like trying to hunt you down when youre in that situation. And that might sound like paranoia, but I mean, you know, youre--youre clearly  You know, we were over by SF State. I predominately worked throughout Sunset--and, you know, out of Richmond and whatnot, and other places in the city. But all San Francisco.  So  you know, you have homeowners that know what youre doing, do not want you there. And have no sympathy or empathy for your situation. And so they would go out of their way just to make sure that  you know--get you kicked out, you know? Cops knocking on your window at night and stuff like that. I:\tWhat kinds of stuff would the homeowners do? Call the cops and tell them? R:\tYeah, they would, you know, make sure that all  you know, that all rules were enforced to 100 percent.  I:\tLike what? R:\tLike leaving it parked somewhere. You know, if it was parked a minute longer than it need be, then, you know, youre SOL. And then the thing actually broke down for a while. And I ended up  I couldnt take it to a shop and fix it, because it needed a part that was no longer available. And I couldnt really work on it myself.  So I ended up having a friend who just basically towed it around from place to place, neighborhood to neighborhood, for about three or four months. And that was pretty rough, you know? Because youre sitting there--you know, $100 every three days to tow a vehicle thats your home now. So that was pretty rough.  Umm  I mean, I had a friend--I have a friend, still--who works in SFPD. And even with him kind of telling people, like, Hey, you know hes not a shithead. Hes not a druggie. Hes not a weirdo. Hes just  you know, kind of got shafted on some housing and whatnot. Even with him telling other officers to back off, wed still get bothered and harassed. Probably law enforcement and just the peoples lack of  of, you know, empathy on the matter.  I:\tDid you ever talk to any of the homeowners who were having tensions with? Or did you ever get an opportunity to talk to them? R:\tNo. I mean, you know, there was one guy, who after he saw me coming home from work clearly, in, you know, construction clothes and whatnot--and he was like, Oh, hey, hows it going man? And kind of let be known that he wasnt going to be a dick about it or anything. Or, he at least, you know, had, you know, some sympathy I guess, maybe.  But no, pretty much, you know, people just look at you like youre just the scum of the earth. Or youre a deadbeat, or youre this, or youre that, and I was like  you know, okay. I:\tDo you think that it made a difference in that time that someone saw you, like, looking like you clearly had a job and were working? Do you think that made a-- R:\tA difference in regards to what? I:\tIn like the perception that people had of you at that time? Or the way that they treated you. R:\tNo, because I mean  I dont know. I mean, we kept it secret from everybody, by and large. You know, our family members that knew it didnt really give a shit. They were just like, Oh, well, I dont know, fuck you. Umm  no, I think by and large, people just stayed  you know, they just assume--oh, youre on drugs, or, oh, youre an alcoholic. Or they assume the worst. They just dont assume that its like--oh, you got the shit end of some dice, you know? And youre making the best of it. I:\tWas there a reason that you werent telling people? That you werent telling the majority of your family? R:\tWell, I mean, like I said, I dont talk to a lot of my family. So, that was why. My mother and stepfather knew, my fiancs parents knew, and that was it. She comes from a decently affluent background, and they were just like, Oh, I dont know you. You know, typical scorn and distain for it, and they kind of disowned her over that factor. And it was like, Oh, okay. Well, whatever. I:\tThey didnt offer to help at all? They didnt offer to help you guys find housing? R:\tNope. I:\tOh, okay. Is that like a point of tension between you now? Is that something that ...? R:\tOh, yeah. Well, I mean, she, uh  it was kind of. I mean, I dont want to speak for her because shes not here, but you know, she felt that she had a kind of a toxic relationship with her mother, and her father just kind of sat back and let her mother do whatever she wanted. So there was already a prebuilt tension and an issue into it. When that hit, it was just, you know, the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak. And uh, you know, it was like she pretty much ... like I said, she pretty much just took herself out of the situation. Like, Well, if youre not going to be supportive and youre not going to offer up any kind of emotional support or anything--and youre going to try to take from me emotionally, then you know--pardon the French--but fuck you. Have a good day. So ... I:\tOkay. Thank you for sharing that. Umm, I might have more questions come up about that situation. R:\tYeah. I:\tI will have more questions about housing situation stuff, so well get to that. R:\tYeah. No problem. I:\tOkay. So, another statement in that was, I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job. R:\tNo. I:\tNo. Disagree. All right. I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tNope. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed. R:\tNope. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support. R:\tNope. I:\tAll right. So, family and friends can be important sources of support. They can also sometimes influence us to do things that arent in our best interest, or be sources of stress. You already kind of started talking about this kind of a thing. R:\tYeah. I:\tBut, if you could think of some relationships with family and friends that provide good examples of what good, supportive kinds of relationships and maybe some that are more examples of the stressful or destructive relationships. And you could just elaborate further. R:\tYeah. I:\tYeah. R:\tSo, you want it specifically? I:\tYeah. Yeah. Specifically. R:\tOh, okay. I:\tI mean, both the good, supportive kind--and that could be family and friends, examples of those relationships and then of the stressful. R:\tYeah. Yeah. I mean, family, I think you kind of get the picture on--you know, is kind of nonexistent and not around. Umm  You know, a real close friend of mine, was again, my friend that works for SFPD. Hes a cop over in the city. Umm  You know, in terms of emotional support--I mean, Ive known him for 20 some odd years. We went to high school here in Vallejo, both moved to San Francisco. We were there for about ten years. You know, and then also him seeing the dynamic that I was in. I mean, he was completely supportive of it. In terms of him being like, I dont know, dude. You know, youre just ... youre fucking stubborn, from the perspective youre not going to just go back and, you know, go move somewhere else or go do this, or you know take an easier option. You know, and especially him working in law enforcement--you know, its kind of outside the usual box. You know, of well, like, Oh, well, my best friend is homeless, working in SanFrancisco, and living here, and blah, blah, blah. So he was a good source of support. My fiance was a great source of support. Thats probably pretty much it for at that point. I:\tAnd currently, do you have, umm ...? R:\tCurrently, I have a friend who  hes a very good soundboard. I think hes going through some emotional issues himself, so hes kind of a little unstable. But I tried to be there for him. And hes been there for me in the past. Him and I race sail boats together. Umm, so. I:\tWhat do you mean when you said, Hes a good soundboard? R:\tWell, the typical thing. Like, I can ... we can just talk about our problems or talk about lives, or you know--wax poetic. You know, whatever it is you want to call it. I:\tThanks for sharing. We can move on from there. So the next set of questions is about relationships with people outside of your family. So, friends, umm. R:\tMy relationships ...? I:\tTo people outside of your family. R:\tOh, yeah. I:\tSo if you could think about up to three people who you feel the closest to, personally. So, your three closest friends, like up to three. If you could think of people like that--how many, between zero and three come to mind? Of like your closest friends? R:\tUmm. Id say two to three. I:\tTwo to three. R:\tOne not being, you know, present. I:\tOkay. Someone who passed away? R:\tYeah. I:\tAll right. So should we, you know, two or three? R:\tYou can say two. Thats fine. I:\tFor your friend who passed away, how long ago was that? R:\tA few years ago now, I think. Yeah. Three, four years. I:\tAnd, that was a close friend? R:\tYeah. I:\tIt sounds insensitive to ask this. How did that make you feel? R:\tYeah. No, thats fine I:\tBut, you know, how did that impact you that had happened? R:\tUmm  Well, it impacted me a lot. He was kind of like a mentor. He was my high school ... one of my high school science teachers. And then him and I were co-owner/operator of a winery locally with all the other ... the Vallejo High Science Program. The guys were all biochemists from their school, and they were all, you know, into wine, too. Started making wine. A few years later it took off, and we developed the contacts and started getting real good with it. So, anyway, so we were involved in business together. But I was also a real deep  you know, intimate that friendship. You know, where he was kind of like a father figure for me when I was in high school. And then after that. So, yeah, I would say he was like a mentor, you know, kind of deal. So, when he passed, it was obviously like ... I:\tIm sorry to hear that. So I guess, thinking about those other two friends that you had in mind--for the first friend you were thinking of, is that person female or male? R:\tMale. I:\tAnd how would you describe his race or ethnicity? R:\tWhite. I:\tAnd how old is he? R:\tUmm  30  This is my buddy, the cop, so its the same. Umm  34; same age as me. I:\tDo you know the highest level of education hes completed? R:\tYeah. A bachelors. I:\tAll right. And then hes currently working for pay? Hes still a cop? All right. Lets see. Do you know if hes receiving any kind of public aid? Like government support? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd is he married or living with a partner? R:\tMarried. I:\tSo then, for the second friend that you were thinking of, is that person male or female? R:\tMale. I:\tAnd how would you describe his race or ethnicity? R:\tWhite. I:\tHow old is he? R:\tFifty-six. I:\tAnd then do you know the highest level of education hes completed? R:\tA masters. I:\tIs he currently working for pay? Does he have a job? R:\tYeah. He works at the VA over in San Francisco. I:\tThe DA? R:\tVA. I:\tYeah. R:\tVeterans, yeah. I:\tDo you know if hes receiving any public aid? R:\tI dont think so. I:\tIs he married or living with a partner? R:\tUmm, no. Hes single, sort of. [Laugh]. I:\tSort of? R:\tYeah. He dates like ten women at one time. I dont know if thats pertinent [laugh] to this. But ... I:\tSo, umm, now Im going to ask you some questions about groups and organizations that you might be a part of, and if you receive any emotional or material support from them. So emotional support, someone who would listen to you when you needed to talk. R:\tRight. I:\tAnd then material support, someone who would provide advice on a job, place to live, transportation, and that kind of a thing. So, do you belong to any kind of a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? Any recreational clubs? R:\tYeah. Several yacht clubs. What else? I raced bikes professionally for about six years, and so theres still that contact there. Umm  I dont know if that counts. I:\tDo you still do it currently? R:\tI got back into it recently. Im trying to train up, because I got some offers to go do it again. So ... I:\tOkay. Would you consider that a sports team or a club? R:\tIts a professional athletic team. So, yeah. I:\tHow often do you participate in the boating clubs or yacht clubs? Is that like daily, weekly, monthly, yearly? R:\tUmm  three times a week. I:\tAll right. Would you be able to turn to those groups for emotional support? R:\tUmm  probably not. But part of that might also be due to myself just not wanting to ask for it with in regards to them. These are more professional contacts than, you know, deep friendships or anything. I:\tOkay. Would you be able to turn to that group for material support? R:\tMaterial support, defined again as ... ? I:\tSo like someone you could talk to for advice about-- R:\tLike money or ...? I:\tYeah. Financial support, advice on finding a place to live, advice on jobs, transportation to work or other appointments? R:\tEmployment. Employment, I could probably network. You know, its a good networking tool obviously. But, for out-and-out hand-me-outs or, you know, cash or stuff like the other ones, no. I:\tBut theres some professional networking? R:\tOf course, its a yacht club. [Laugh]. I:\tYeah. [Laugh]. So, sorry, did you say that with the biking you were doing racing? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd that you would qualify as a sports team? R:\tWhats that? I:\tA sports team, would that--? R:\tYeah. Thats a professional deemed athletic team. So, yeah. I:\tOkay. How often do you participate? I know you just said you were just getting back. R:\tUmm  Well, I just  umm. Well, like I said, for six years, it was, you know, my life. It was every day, all day. You know, in the saddle training or going to races or travel to races. Then, I quit when  right around the time when we became homeless. Then it was like--oh, well, I need  I:\tWere you doing that-- R:\tI need to get a better job that pays more, one. And two, that its kind of hard to train, living on the street. So that was kind of a difficult thing. You had a question? I:\tOh, was that in San Francisco? R:\tCorrect. I:\tIn and around San Francisco? R:\tYeah. Pretty much. Yeah, all the training is predominately in Marin Valley. All  over the Golden Gate Bridge on the other side. I:\tOkay. When you are getting back into it now, like how often do you think youre going to be doing it? R:\tThe training, or the racing, or what? I:\tI guess, any aspect of it. R:\tWell, the training is, you know, almost every day, six days a week. I:\tOh, wow. Okay. R:\tTwo to five, six, seven hours a day, depending on  The racing--the racing season is pretty much done right now. Im just taking the time right now to kind of have the elongated off-season to cut weight and to do all the other stuff, and then go in the next season. And then after that, you race probably, you know, fourtofive times a week. So its quite a bit. I:\tOkay. So, that would be almost a daily thing, once you get back into the swing of it? R:\tIts a full-time job. Yeah. Its more than a full-time job. Yeah. I:\tIs it difficult to balance that with work? R:\tUmm  yeah. I mean, its, you cant work a, umm  umm. You cannot work a normal 9:00 to 5:00. Sorry, my lower back hurts. But its  you cant work a normal 9:00 to 5:00, because not too many, you know  umm, jobs are, you know, are going to allow you to train that kind of hours or come in, you know, dead tired or this or that.  So you either end up working in bicycle shops, you know--half days. Or you have to kind of have your own little hustle and your own little small business. So, like case in point, umm, I also had an automotive restoration background that I grew up in--so I just called upon that where I can, without going too far into a bunch of stuff that you wont care about probably, its  umm. I:\tNo. Anything you want to share. R:\tTheres a particular class of old sailboats that are  umm  me and two other guys have essentially reinvigorated the one designed? 26:29] class. I have the restoration background. They had work on [inaudible 26:34] financiers, and then once we got it up and going. So now we find the boats. Umm, you know, I source all the stuff, restore them, and we have pretty much presold to, you know, clients who want a, you know, turnkey race boat kind of deal. So with that, I get to create my own schedule. So ... I:\tAnd thats what youre doing right now? R:\tCorrect. I:\tOkay. So that works with the training schedule if you need it to or if you want it to? R:\tSince, well, you know, like, I mean, you know, I live right down the road here, and I have what--one, two, three, four of these boats sitting in our  the property there. And so if  I dictate what I want to do. Like after this, Im going to go on a training ride. I get back, Im going to work on the boat almost the whole day--and Ill do this or Ill do that. I:\tOkay. With regard to the biking, are you doing it with other people? R:\tWell, you know, up here Im finding contacts for it. But, umm  I mean, you know, theres clubs. Theres plenty of people and types that ride bicycles and whatnot. But umm, the racing I do is a real niche, real specialized. So most of the training will be on my own, with occasional social rides with people. You know, for sponsors or for, you know, whatever. So, yeah, most of its, you know pretty much solo. Ill go ride on group rides and stuff. But the training is [indifferent? 27:58], you know? I:\tWhen there are the instances when you are interacting with other people doing groups rides and whatnot, can you turn to those people for emotional support? No? R:\tThese are acquaintances, at best. Or, again, theyre sponsors. I:\tOkay. So, no material--? R:\tWhom you dont really want to talk to about  Well, I dont know. Well see. I mean, because I guess, you know, the sponsors--you know, if I do pursue this, you know, all the way again and I do end up, you know, racing, you know, the [P-1-2? 28:28] again, then it would be a matter of, umm  You know, they are paying your bills at a certain point. They are paying your race registrations, your travel, your airfare. You know, whatever. And then also all the equipment and kit and everything. And bikes. Thats all free. So, I guess, then ... I:\tSo, theres some potential for material support? R:\tCorrect. Correct. I:\tBut its very specific. R:\tRight now, no. Right now, no. I:\tOkay. Umm. I think Ill put, Yes, thinking about like in the future. R:\tCorrect. Yeah. Yeah. I:\tLike, when youre [inaudible 28:59]. R:\tYeah. For six years my bills were paid. You know, barely. You know, bike racing is very niche in this country. I didnt pay for anything, and all the equipment and travel and everything was free. So thats definitely a support system. You know  obviously. But the instant you dont perform, or this or that--you know?  I:\tOkay, so its not necessarily the most stable form of support? R:\tNo. No. Its probably the least stable form of support. Im sure as you can imagine. I:\tOkay. Are you a part of any music or artist group? R:\tNope. I:\tUmm, any crew or gang or anything like that? R:\t[Laugh]. No. I:\tAny local government group? A civic association? R:\tUmm  I:\tLike coming together with people to solve some kind of problem? R:\tNo. I:\tNo. Any kind of support group? R:\tNope. I:\tAny other kind of group or organization that youre a part of, that I didnt cover on the list? Lets see. So now Im going to ask you some questions about your employment history. So how old were you when you had your first job? R:\t13. I:\tWhat was it? R:\tWorking in my fathers automotive restoration [inaudible 30:14]. I:\tWas that where you picked up those skills? R:\tI grew up with it, so ... I:\tSo how much of your adult have you been employed? So all of it, most of it, some of it, little of it? R:\tAll of it. The least employment I ever had was the six years racing bikes, which was employment, but were athletes, so its a little bit different. I:\tSo you feel like its different than  R:\tWell, you know, I feel most people categorize it differently. Most people think, Oh, profession athlete, theyre not the same as, you know, digging ditches all day long or building a house or something like that. I:\tDo you feel like  Would you call it a different [inaudible 30:56]? R:\tOh  Would I call it different? I:\tYeah, like how do you think about it? [Inaudible 31:01]. R:\tYeah, I would say its shittier and harder and for less pay. I:\tReally? R:\tYou dont make  you make enough money in this country unless youre in the number one spot. You make enough to survive and thats about it. I:\tYou mentioned that when youre doing it youre getting sponsored. People are paying your bills, so theyre paying like  do they pay rent for you? Do they cover those costs of living? R:\tWithout getting too far into it, you get little envelopes of cash. At the end of the race you get an envelope with two grand in it or an envelope with 1,500 [inaudible 31:34]. And its kind of strange  without going into the structure of it, but like  So when youre on a cycling team, youll have a race you go to--all that shits paid for. And then the equipment, all the travel, everythings paid for. During the race you can have--obviously prize money and cash [inaudible 31:50]. And so thats usually divvied up amongst the guys, based upon performance and whos doing what work. And then sponsors will [inaudible 32:00] at the end. You know, and sometimes youll get an envelope with 2,500 bucks. Sometimes youll get an envelope with 100 bucks. So it just all kind of depends. I:\tSo its kind of variable? R:\tVery much. I:\tSo we already started getting into this a little bit, but what skills do you bring to the labor market and how did you [inaudible 32:17]?  R:\tYeah, I worked as a mechanic. Ive worked as a body tech  I:\tA what? R:\tBody tech. Its like automotive restoration--some body work. What else? Ive worked in construction. Ive worked in terrazzo mosaics. I dont know if you know what that is, but  All throughout San Francisco, all the stairways you see that look like theyre made of stone. Those are all terrazzo, which is a marble aggregate in a color-pigmented cement. So its kind of niche. Theres only two companies in the City that did it. One was my boss and, you know, there was [inaudible 33:03]. So I did that. I did mosaic work, like stone mosaics; marble mosaics and so  I:\tHow did you learn that? Where did you pick that up? R:\tI just went and worked for them. I:\tOh okay, so you learned on the job? R:\tYeah, I  basically you just start out at the bottom and work your way up. Ive known him. His name was [name]--old Italian guy--and he basically  Him and my father used to race motorcycles together and I used to ride with them and stuff and so Ive known him for like probably [inaudible 33:36]. So one day I was living in the city; I was looking for some supplemental income and he was like, Eh, [name], want to come work? I said, Sure, no problem, and that worked into more of a permanent working relationship, so  I:\t[Inaudible 33:53]? I mean, the bike racing? Is that something  R:\tAutomotive sales--yeah. I wouldnt list  I mean, bike racing isnt really a job market skill set, I dont think. I mean  I:\tYou make income off of it, right? R:\tYou do, but like I said, its  You know, theres no 401Ks, theres no retirement funds. Its very cut-throat and its kind of like a real short window with which you could do it and its really  I would refer to it in the U.S.  unless youre the national champion, its more of a hustle. Its almost probably bordering along the illegal income lines, so  I:\tAny other labor markets? R:\tWhatever I want to go do. I dont know. I:\tDo you  Most of the stuff that you know how to do, like car restoration and like construction work, is that all stuff you picked up on the job or is that stuff you had specific training for? R:\t Yeah. I learned the old way, where you  Like in the shops, you start out sweeping floors and then you work your way up. In terrazzo, you start out doing all the grunt work--demo work and demotion work. And then of course if youre good and youve got some kind of acuity to do the task and you work up and start grinding stairs and you start fabricating and you move up, so  No trade school, though.  I:\tAre there any skills that youre trying to learn now or that youd like to learn in the future--job related? R:\tYeah, I would contemplate going and getting a skippers license for boats. They have whats called a hundred tonner license, which is you can operate a boat--skipper a boat--anything up to 100 tons. And so I contemplated going and getting that. Im thinking about going back to school. Thats another option because Ive got two years in; a good GPA and I thought, Well, you know, I could go finish that up. Thats another option. I:\tWhat would you be school for? Do you know? R:\tI was a history major at the lower division stuff, but unless I was going to go to law school or something like that, its kind of a useless degree. So I dont know. I have to either rewrite it, some of the lower division stuff, or just kind of run with it and just go, Oh, I dont know  history degree. Just to have it.  I:\tWere you planning on going to law school? R:\tInitially, yeah.  I:\tIs that something that you would consider trying to do at this point, or at a future point? R:\tIts crossed my mind, but probably not, just because it would be a little late in the game.  I:\tAny other job-related skills that youre thinking about? R:\t[Inaudible 36:51], no.  I:\tAre there non-job-related skills that you want to acquire? R:\tOh, I dont know.  I:\tIt seemed like you  R:\tNo, no, no  I was just laughing at the question itself. Like, someone goes, Oh, Im beer-pong champion, or some shit.  I:\t So Im going to read you a list of possible or potential barriers to employment that you may have had and you could tell me if any of these apply. So has education, training or experience, ever been a barrier to employment? R:\tYeah, probably--yeah. I:\tOkay. Transportation? Has it ever been a barrier between employment; getting a job? Keeping a job? Any of  R:\tSure, yeah.  I:\tFamily obligations? Has that ever been a barrier? R:\tYes. I:\tLack of jobs? R:\tYeah, sure. Anybody can say yeah to that one, maybe. I:\tWhat? R:\tIm sure anybody can say yes to that one. I:\tEmployer discrimination? Has that ever been an issue? R:\tNo. I:\tCriminal [inaudible 37:51]? Has that ever been a barrier for a job [37:55]? R:\tNope. I:\tDomestic violence? R:\tNope. I:\tMental and/or physical health? R:\tUh  no. I:\tHomelessness or housing instability? [Inaudible 38:05]. Anything else thats been a barrier to employment--getting a job, keeping a job? R:\tUm  Probably not directly, but like one of the thing with the homelessness is you accrue a whole shit-load of parking tickets, you know. And so of course that stuff starts adding up and when youre trying to like shimmy around and find stable housing; maintain employment, all this kind of stuff  I dont know if you could file that under  I:\tIt sounds like what youre talking about is really related to the housing instability R:\tCorrect--yeah, yeah. I:\tAnd well have it on our transcript, so it will  What youre saying would be  R:\tYeah. I:\tSo you currently have the one job right now? On the boats? R:\tI wouldnt call it a job, but  I:\tWhat would you call it? R:\tWell the word job is like what people  This is a job; what people do. They dont want to do it. They go do it because they need some meager income to pay their bills and that kind of shit. I would categorize it as something that I call upon my skill sets to do  I:\tAre you passionate about it? Is this something that you like doing? R:\tOh yeah, yeah, of course. You dont get into restoring weird old sailboats and then building a racing fleet of them and all that without being passionate about it.  I:\tSo you feel like its a passion or a hobby or  [Inaudible 39:57] niche skill that you have thats not very common.  R:\tI dont know anybody else that does it.  I:\tWhat would you call yourself? Like what would your job title be if you had to have one? R:\tOh, I dont know  owner operator? I:\tWhen did you start restoring? R:\tBoats? Two years ago, I think. I:\tOkay. Like 2014?  R:\tThat was essentially how I escaped the homelessness at first, was we just bought a boat and said, Oh, well just live on a boat. I:\tAnd that was in San Francisco? R:\tNo, I was living here in Vallejo.  I:\tOkay, so you moved from San Francisco to the boat? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd then were you able to make enough money  Do you live in a house or an apartment now? R:\tYeah, we have a little  We have some property with a loft and a shop and everything [inaudible 41:09].  I:\tDo you work full-time or part-time? I know you said your hours were  R:\tPart-time. I mean, it amounts to being full-time, you know, because its what you make of it.  I:\tBut most of the times its a part-time  R:\tFour hour days--yeah. I:\tHow did you find the job? I dont know if thats like an applicable question  I mean, you said you worked with someone else who  R:\tYeah, [inaudible 41:37] I bought the sailboat [inaudible 41:40] living on. Struck up a friendship with a guy whos into racing boats, but [inaudible 41:47]. Then him and I started sailing and racing together and then we found out about this niche group of defunct racing boats in the 60s that was all sitting in Stockton and abandoned. So we said, Oh yeah, well put our money together, and went and bought all the fleet; moved into the estuary, you know  [inaudible 42:12] pretty much pre-sold. I dont know if that answers your question. I:\tI think so. R:\tAgain, its not like  I didnt come in with a job application, obviously. Its a completely different hustle, so  I:\t[Inaudible 42:29]. R:\tProbably the most [inaudible 42:35], yeah. I:\tOkay. We talked about how you dont really have a good idea of how much money  Theres not like a certain  Its not like youre making [inaudible 42:47]  R:\tI mean, I know how much month to month will come in, because I know this boat will be done by this date; this boat is done by this date. This person wants this boat by that date and so you have a general idea what  I:\tSo on what youre working on right now, like how much are you [inaudible 43:03] that youre working on? R:\tTwelve grand--12 to 15 grand. I:\tAnd when will that be? Literally, in a typical month, I guess. Like what would you [inaudible 43:15] if you were working on a typical [inaudible 43:17]? R:\tUm  I dont know. Thats why I say  its still in its formative part, so its kind of hard for me to give you a [inaudible 43:25]. I:\tThats fine. Ill just leave that  R:\tIn one month I can make 12 grand. The next month I can make nothing. The month after that I can make six grand and the next month I can make 20 grand, so  I:\tOkay, Ill just leave that one blank. Where did you last month  what was your job before this? Thats the tile work, right? R:\tNot tile work--mosaics and terrazzo work, yeah. I:\tWhat was your job title? R:\tTerrazzo mechanic. Its another weird, old niche  Im sure you can see by now the penchant for niche little things that Ive kind of fallen into or come out and just found me. But its  you never call it tile work, but  I:\tWhen did you start in that job? R:\tI started that in 2010. I:\tDo you remember what month? R:\tI have no idea.  I:\tIll just put June. R:\tYeah, sounds good. I:\t2010? R:\tThe end of the race season was in September, so it was probably actually about September. Because I think I was sitting there and I was like, Oh, the race seasons over; could use some extra money. I was literally riding on a train ride and I ran into my friend, who I hadnt talked to in like three years and, Eh, are you working? Want to come work? I said, Yeah sure, I have nothing else to do right now. I:\tWas that full-time, part-time? R:\tFull-time. I:\tAnd then  so that was an acquaintance, friend? R:\tGood friend, yeah. I:\tHow much were you earning at that job? R:\tNot much. Like maybe 2,500 a month or so. It was all cash under the table [inaudible 45:42]. I:\tWas there a particular reason why the job ended? R:\tYeah, he actually got caught for not pulling permits when he was supposed to in San Francisco. What he did was actually he  Long story short, he had  In San Francisco, an inspector that wanted us to do his stairway and landing and Stephano gave him a price. The guy didnt like the price; they bitched back and forth. The next thing you know, the inspector [inaudible 45:20], so  I:\tOkay, so did his whole shop close? R:\tIt closed for a year and then he asked if I wanted to go back. And I was [inaudible 46:28]. I:\tWas there a reason why you didnt want to go back? Were you worried about it being unstable? R:\tWell, it was  Him and I either were going to branch out and make a partnership  and its very lucrative, you know. He was making about 220 above ground. He was realistically making more like 280.  I:\tA year? R:\tA year. He was making good money. He owns a multimillion dollar home in Los Gatos, you know, all the toys and shit. It was one of those things where it was like I knew that if I was going to continue on with him, there was going to be some stability issues with  Hes a real old-school Italian guy and so the way he thinks  You know, the way the world was back when they used to do a good job was completely different than now. So it was that and it was either  You know, I was basically trying to take over the business, but there was some business things that I didnt like. That combined with  I kind of just didnt really want to do the work anymore. It was enough to make me go, Fuck it, I dont want to do it. I:\t[Inaudible 47:27]. R:\tWell maybe, Hey, were doing this fucking job, you got to  Sorry for the expletives, but I was like, Hey, we go to [inaudible 47:38]. Next thing you know, if you do that  You figure a stairway was about  to replace one went about 90 grand per job. Thats about a month, maybe six months of work. So its decent money, you know. Youre making good money. This came out an extra 1,500 dollars [inaudible 48:05] for six weeks of work. Its like pretty fucking stupid, I thought, so  Youve in business for 32 years and so things like that definitely pull him to the 21st century way of doing things, but at the same time I saw there being some liability issues that I did not want to have a part of.  I was not bonding and so I was going to have to go get bonded and pay out the ass for this other stuff and it was  If I was still passionate about doing it, I would have done it. But I was not. Its really hard work. It sounds like romantic, Oh, beautiful mosaics  and then was only beautiful, but  Its just really nasty [inaudible 48:48] work and very technical work, and so  restoring boats is much easier.  I:\tOh really? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. Was the mosaic work, was that job typical of the kinds of jobs youve held [inaudible 49:02]? R:\tYep. Typically hard labor, real technical aspects  you know, the stuff that you dont--theres no trade school for terrazzo, in America, anyway. You go to Italy and there is, but here its very niche. You start out basically shoveling shit, so to speak, from the bottom and work your way up.  I:\tWere there any similar kind of jobs youve had, or was that one where you were making [inaudible 49:32]? R:\tIts pretty shitty at first. But yeah, it got to where it was decent. You know, 25-35 hundred a month over in San Francisco  even cash under the table, its still not a lot of money when rents 3,800 dollars a month.  I:\tIn general, can you describe your experiences in the job market so far? Youve already shared a lot of job experience [inaudible 50:00] but think from like your first job, moving through  like the kinds of jobs you had  And you can go quickly over the ones youve already talked about at length.  R:\tOh yeah. Whats the underlying question? I:\tJust your experiences in the job market. R:\tIve a million different jobs. When I was going to school I was working in a shop  working in a gas station part-time. I worked at fucking Togos making sandwiches. Ive worked at Barnes and Nobles, just so I could get a deal on books, you know, typical  You know, [inaudible 50:33], you get paid and then whatnot [50:36]. So stuff from bonehead stuff on to [inaudible 50:40] to highly technical  and pardon the term bonehead but I mean, you know, stuff that doesnt require any skill set to do. You show up, you shut up, you do it. Ranging from that to stuff that is very highly technical and not a lot of people running around can do it. I:\tIs there a particular kind of work that you enjoy the most? R:\tTypically I do enjoy something thats physical, but also is very technical. The terrazzo was  If it would have been with a different person, I probably would still be doing that right now. I wouldnt be doing the super physical stuff. Id hire somebody else and let him do that. I would just be doing the real technical restoration work. Like we did restoration work on some Art Deco era buildings over in San Francisco in the Sunset. So stuff like that, its beautiful; its appealing. You know, its romantic; its nice. You know, picking up 200 pound stairs and 400 pound stairs and moving that shit all day. You know, working on peoples homes  I:\t[Inaudible 51:46] hard. R:\tIt is. It is back-breaking work.  I:\tCan you tell me about your most positive work experience and what made it so positive? R:\tYou mean like a singular experience? I:\tYeah, it could be a singular experience. It could be like if theres one job in particular, or  Has there been a singular experience that is like your most  R:\tTheres a couple in the terrazzo field that were pretty rewarding. They were all in really high-end homes in the City; from the Broadway mansions over in the City. And you know, youre working on this house, its a 100 plus years old. Its had all these different families that have been through it and its real nice, beautiful  You know, kind of like a piece of art. Then youre  you know, at my young age being told, Oh, so youre doing the restoration on this, and its got to look like it did originally. So when all the hard work  in the end you saw the end result. That was very rewarding. Of course, people patted you on the back and all that stuffs important as well. We all like accolades, so there was some things with that. Theres been a couple cars that Ive built, that the end result was like, Oh, thats beautiful. But it was the work along the way that was also rewarding. So the combination of the two--yeah. I:\tCould you tell me about your most negative work experience and what made it particularly negative? R:\tYeah, people just being  maybe on the sympathy/empathy thing and people just being really  It might sound egotistical, but people just being narrow-minded and just being shitty to one another for no reason other than either competition or  You know, one of my jobs  I worked at a [inaudible 53:52] was slinging tires and light mechanical for a company. And the boss was a dick. He was a dick to everybody. Hes just a very unpleasant, toxic person to be around and [inaudible 54:07] and so the whole shop became nonproductive. And I eventually, Fuck you, Im leaving. So I left [inaudible 54:14]. But just things like that, you know--narrow-mindedness. I:\tIs there anything youd like to add or talk about more, about work experiences?  So the following questions are about experiences you may have had with substance abuse. Just remember, all your responses are kept private and if theres anything you dont want to talk about, just me know.  R:\tYeah. I:\tHave you ever had a drinking or drug problem? R:\tDrinking a little bit--yeah. I:\tHow old were you when that started? R:\tUm  I dont know. It kind of coincided with some of the homeless stuff. You know, for a period of like a few months it was where it wasnt just social drinking. It wasnt just, Its fun to be a little tipsy or a little drunk, it was youre really drinking hard for like the purpose of just not feeling your emotions and stuff. And so, yeah  I:\tAnd that was a couple years ago? R:\tYeah. I:\tYou were 31? R:\tWell Im 34. It would have been right in the middle of the homeless chunk, or probably right after. And then at 32, 33ish, I guess  I:\tDid you ever receive any treatment for  R:\t No, I just quit.  I:\tIt sounds like from what you were saying it was very situational kind of drinking? R:\tYeah, yeah, well it was  My fianc and I were like, Fuck, we work our ass off, all this and were not getting ahead and weve got no support system. You know, it was a lot of negative factors that had  I saw we could have gone one direction; just gone all the way down the rabbit hole and that would have been bad. Or we can just be tough about it and just go  keep working and quit drinking so much.  I:\tWas that an issue that you were having [inaudible 56:19]? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you feel like you have a drinking problem now? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd you just decided its not something you wanted to do anymore? R:\tOh yeah. You know, I was sitting around  it was kind of like--fuck , its expensive, one. And two, I was previously this real elite athlete and it was like you start losing all that. It was just wasnt something I wanted to go all the way down the hole into.  I:\tWas there anything that you did to help you stop? Was there anything like any supports, any programs, any  R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Have you ever had any issues with alcohol or drugs previously in your life? R:\tNo. I mean, you could say yes; you could say no. The night I got arrested--and thats why were talking--Id gone to a music show. I was a little too drunk. Me and some friends were walking back and those little construction zones, you know, the sawhorse [inaudible 57:22]? Well those got knocked over and the next thing you know some guys yelling, Cock-suckers picking up  And so you continue walking and all of a sudden I hear a bunch of footsteps and shit. And I could hear the slide of a gun rack. Oh shit. So I assumed we were getting robbed. Its like turn around and have my friends and my fianc take off  whatever, just leave. I turned around to meet them and it turned out to be a [inaudible 57:53]. And so I threw my hands in the air. They came in and beat the shit out of me and then when I resisted they get me in cuffs. And then after I was in cuffs, the lead guy looked around and took a few free shots and opened my face up. And that was essentially what happened.  Post that what happened was it was a my friend  The police officer, his brothers also a pretty high-ranking police officer. It was one of his buddies who was the one that did it. And so he had an option of like, Look man, if you pursue this, hes going to lose his job. Or just shut up and just take the slap on the wrist from the court system and go through this thing and thats that.  I:\tIf youd like fought your case, someone would have lost their job because [inaudible 58:44]? R:\tNo, we had him on video after I was in cuffs having never resisted at all. And he was literally on video. He looks around. Im in cuffs and hes just wailing on me--just absolutely wailing on me. So it was completely excessive force and then after that he gets up and kicks me out. I shouldnt have been intoxicated. Maybe it wouldnt have happened. We were a bunch of kids out partying and [inaudible 59:19]. I:\tYou were saying  Our conversation about this was prompted by me asking if you ever had any other substance abuse. Do you feel like that was an issue? R:\tWell I feel like there was  My responsibility portion of that was  I was out, I was intoxicated and with friends and we were out being obnoxious and whatnot, you know, on the streets. Was it worthy of then getting shit kicked out of you and then when I got arrested they said I had a firearm. They basically  What they do is they do whats called jamming you up. I dont know if you know that term.  I:\tCould you explain what you mean by it? R:\tWell, so cops who arrest you--or detain you, whatever it is--your police contact  They beat the shit out of you  if they do that  Then if they do, they have to explain why. And so the way they do it is they [inaudible 60:08] charges. They had me as a felony charge, attempted assault with a firearm  three or four or five felonies. They were all trying to explain why I came in there with stitches and my face swollen out to here and blood all over. And even the intake person in the jail was like, Yeah, youll probably be out in a few days, so dont worry about this, because this is bullshit, you know. And sure enough, they ORd me after like two days [inaudible 60:40]. Its shitty, but its a fact.  I:\tThat people get jammed up? R:\t[Inaudible 60:48]. I:\tThank you for sharing that. Im definitely going to have more questions about that. And that was the arrest that led to diversion? R:\tCorrect. I:\tOkay. Ill have a bunch more questions about that coming up. Is there anything else youd like to add or talk about related to substance abuse issues? R:\tUh, no. I:\tSo now Im going to ask you about your mental and emotional health. Again, our responses are kept private. If theres anything you dont want to talk about, just let me know. Have you ever been told by a professional, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, that you had a mental or emotional condition or symptoms of one? R:\tNo. No, the closest thing would be when I was younger and my parents split up, they brought me in the typical thing, you know, in school. Oh, are you depressed, are you this? And they were like, Oh, hes probably got some depression, or whatnot. And there was no more of it afterwards. I:\tAnd that was when you were age  Do you remember? R:\t Seven years old.  I:\tOkay. So have you ever thought that you might have an emotional or mental condition that wasnt ever diagnosed? R:\tUm  Naw, no more than, you know  I dont know. Id say no more than the average person. But I dont know. I mean, not really. I think Im  Im not like a sociopath. Im not a mere jerk. Thats about it. Im not a mean and nasty and malicious to people and people dont think that, you know, multiple personalities. So Im pretty normal. I:\tLets see. Have you ever thought that you might have a learning disability or processing issue of any kind that was never diagnosed? R:\tNo. Schools always been very easy. I:\tOh yeah? Okay, have you ever taken a medication prescribed by a psychiatrist? R:\tNope. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental hospital [inaudible 62:44]? R:\tNope. I:\tHave you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of a potential emotional health [inaudible 62:52]? R:\t[Inaudible 62:55]. I:\tDo you feel that you have any emotional or mental [inaudible 63:02]? R:\t[Inaudible 63:06]. I:\tHave your emotional and mental health [inaudible 63:11] changed over the years? R:\t[Inaudible 63:14]. I:\tAnything youd like to add or talk about more about [inaudible 63:16]? R:\tNo. I:\tSo now Im going to ask you about your interactions with the police. These questions could be sensitive [inaudible 63:23] depending on your experiences, so just remember that youre not required to answer any of them and we can take a break at any point [inaudible 63:29]. So about how many times have you been arrested or detained? R:\tUh, just that one time. I:\tAnd what were you arrested for? R:\tThe charge went down as, like I said, a host of felonious--assault on a peace officer of law, attempted assault with a firearm  I mean, it was like five felonies they hit me with. And then an investigator--an inspector--[inaudible 64:05] in San Francisco came in and started to lean on me. You know, the typical shit you see in the movies. We got you on tape. We know you have a gun. All this this kind of  I dont have shit. Well take a look at the tape, you know. So he was trying to essentially confess to things that I did not do just to make it a slam dunk, real easy thing on their end. And when I finally ended the conversation, quietly I just said, Fuck you. I know youre not on my side and I know what youre trying to do. [Inaudible 64:31] six or seven law enforcement agents in my family--my immediate family--so I did kind of grow around  So I knew how the system worked and so long story short, that was that.  I:\tHow old were you when that happened--this arrest?  R:\tI dont know  29; 30, I think. Twenty-nine, I think, actually. I:\tYouve already kind of described to me the event of the arrest. Did you know  you said you thought you were being robbed--that someone was  R:\tNo. I:\tThat you thought someone was coming up to you so you  R:\tIt was in a  I dont know if you know the city at all, but it was over by [inaudible 65:18], kind of like a shit-hole neighborhood, like around there. And so with there being an interaction between the group I was in and the guy upstairs yelling and the I hear a bunch of footsteps and like a slide of the [inaudible 65:35] and Im like, Ah fuck, we have some problems. [Inaudible 65:39]. I saw that they had boots and light rails in the gun. I figured these are obviously law enforcement. So I took my hands up and  I:\tRight. Were you  R:\t[Inaudible 65:51]. I:\tYeah, so I take it that you did not feel like you were treated fairly in this instance. R:\tNo, no, no. It was literally  Everybody, even one of the arresting officers--because they know if youve been to the  I had to go and stitch up my eye and stuff. And so he said something to the extent of like, Hey man, Im sorry this happened. This was a bad, bad arrest. You were in just the wrong place in the wrong time. And also, knowing what I know of law enforcement   I had applied and was a [inaudible 66:25] officer candidate in San Francisco and passed all--everything was fast tracked and like I was down to the backgrounds check. They were doing the backgrounds and then the 2008 crisis thing hit. So then they held off on running the academy class for like half a yeah and so then they said, Oh, youre on whats called a dead list. You have to reapply. So I was moved to San Francisco initially to be a cop, to join  just to go with my buddy. And I passed everything and they said, Well youre on a dead list. Well keep your posted score because it was high. So then you can keep your written score, but then you have to redo all the tests. And I said, I dont want to fuck with all that. I was watching my buddy. It kind of  That kind of fucked him up a lot, so  I:\tHow so? R:\tEmotionally--drinks a lot; paranoid. You know, the typical shit you hear about with law enforcement guys. I watched him go from being like just an absolute sweetheart, kind of soft kind guy, to this real hardened, jaded  Hes still a sweet guy, but very jaded, very unhappy. But the job pays well enough for him to stay at and thats about it. Sorry tangentially to answer your question like that. I:\tNo, no, no. Its really good to hear the things experienced. Its all good. Aside from the physical abuse, were your rights violated in any other ways? Were you read your rights when they arrested you? R:\tNo, they arrested my fianc and actually they arrested her and she was not drunk. And she was just yelling hysterically, because shes watching them kick the shit out of me. And Im in cuffs and then shes watching them continue to kick the shit out of me and then head wounds bleed real bad. So its just fucking pool of blood and I have long hair and its all covered in blood. And she was yelling just absolutely hysterically and so they took her in, arrested her, you know, on public intox. And she fought it and of course it was like, Oh, well  alright, youre released. Thats it. I:\tOkay. Was she the one who was filming? You said that you had it on film. R:\tNo, no. The TACT unit, which is what they call SWAT  The tact unit building has cameras all over it externally. So their own fucking camera caught him doing this to me, which is the irony of it, so  I:\tWas there a reason why it was SWAT people and not just regular officers like on a beat? R:\tOh yeah, because TACT guys  It was the bad mistake of me and my buddies happened to walk by obnoxiously past the TACT unit building.  I:\tOh okay, so thats why they were  R:\tYeah, this little sign gets knocked over. One of the TACT officers yells to him, You mother-fucker, pick that up. And one of my buddies was saying, Fuck you, whatever. So then of course  We continue walking. They come downstairs. And my friends were like smaller guys and there were a bunch of women also. Sounds like, Oh, were going to get robbed. You guys go get cops. Ill turn around and fight these guys and get robbed or just delay them. Insider information is that  what Im giving you is  TACT units are guys that are like super highly trained, but they dont really do a lot. They sit around all day like lifting weights; do a lot of training--real specialized training. But they can often times  The joke with them in the law enforcement units are that theyre bored, theyre over-trained and theyre real anxious. Theyre always just looking for something to go do, especially the notion of someone to go tune up, which is tune up [inaudible 70:21]. Ironically enough, me as a Q-2 officer candidate [inaudible 70:30] and I wasnt a candidate when that happened. I think my candidacy ended like four years [inaudible 70:36].  I:\tAfter they  They went with you to the hospital to get stitched up? R:\tOne of them did. One or two of them did. Because now youre under arrest--youre a criminal. They have you on all these trumped up charges and then they  The one guy was in the room with me. I:\tOkay. Then did they take you to booking after that? R:\tYep. I:\tWere you given a phone call? R:\tUh  yeah, I was--yeah. Once I got in  after the intake process, yeah.  I:\tAnd then did you have access to a lawyer or public defender? R:\tUh  no.  I:\tNo? R:\tNo, they threw me  They put me in whats called ad seg. I:\tIm sorry, what? R:\tAd seg--administrative segregation.  I:\t[Inaudible 71:19]. R:\tThe real reason, or the  I:\tYeah, what do you think was the real reason? R:\tWell what Ive been told was that because they knew theyd fucked up my ass a little too much based on what charges they had, which was at best public intox, you know? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tSo what they do is they hide you up in ad seg and then they wait a few days  Pretty much try to lean on you; get you to admit to the charges. If they cant and you withstand that, then you just get [inaudible 71:50] and then thats that. So, make sense? I:\tYeah. So they held you for two days? R:\tI dont remember. It was between two and three days. I was pretty concussed, you know. Id lost consciousness a couple times throughout it and Id never lost consciousness in my entire life. It was pretty severe. I have pictures if you want to see it.  I:\tDid they  R:\tIll show you the intake photo. I:\tDid they give you access to any kind of medical treatment or anything? Oh my gosh.  R:\tIt looks like I was chubby there. I was actually very, very svelte and skinny. I:\tIt looks like your eyes completely swollen shut.  R:\tAnd this was all done  I mean, I didnt resist one bit.  I:\tIm so sorry.  R:\tYeah. I:\tThats awful. R:\tShit happens.  I:\tDid they give you access to any kind of medical treatment while you were  I mean, you said you were passing out; you were concussed  R:\tNo, like I said, I sat in the [inaudible 72:01] with some guys and very quickly then they said, Oh, youre going upstairs. They put me in ad seg; sat on me there. Took me out of my cell after about two or three days; tried to lean on me with an inspector. I told him to go fuck himself  well you know, pretty much. They may have kept me in there another half day or something and then they released me in the middle of the night.  I:\tSo were you convicted of anything that time, or did you already [inaudible 73:33]? You said you have to participate in diversion  R:\tIt was  I had a court date to report to and they said you can choose to fight it. And I was kind of  again, if I was going to fight it, it was going to cause other problems within a certain district or it might have [inaudible 73:55] and some other stuff. And then also I was kind of  [inaudible 73:59]. If I get the guy from TACT fired, or even not fired  If they just send him to A and R, which is theyll pull officers off the street and theyll put in A and R [inaudible 74:11]. You know, whats to stop this guy from [inaudible 74:15] and finishing the job, or something. So it was better, I thought, just to go along with the flow of things.  I:\tOkay, so you were afraid of possible retribution and  R:\tOh yeah, yeah. I:\tOkay.  R:\tI literally told my friend  I probably shouldnt say this, but I told him  You know, Id box when I was younger and stuff. So I told my friends who worked there, I said, Look, this was kind of bullshit. This guy [inaudible 74:46] my ass while in cuffs, and all this. You tell him well meet at a boxing gym and finish the job mano a mano. You know, [inaudible 74:53]. But obviously the guy never wanted to show up, so  I:\tSo I have a set of questions  its about your experience with any jail time, incarceration and any probation or parole. Did you ever go to juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd then that jail time, what that the first time youd gone to jail? R:\t[Inaudible 75:13]. I:\tAnd you were 29 or 30? R:\tTwenty-nine, yeah 29.  I:\tYou were only there for a couple days, like two or three days? R:\tId say between three and four days. I:\tOkay. Have you ever been to prison? R:\t[Inaudible 75:34]. I:\tHave you ever been on probation or parole of any kind? R:\tIve been a good boy all my life, with the exception of  This was the first run-in I ever had with law enforcement. They said I was seeking to work in law enforcement for a while and so it was kind of  It was real surprising to end up on this end of it. I was like, Oh wow--shit. I:\tSo Im going to read you some statements that describe how you might feel about legal authorities. So respond with the same [inaudible 76:02]: strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree or strongly disagree. I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. Strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree. R:\tUm . I would say I disagree. I mean  I:\tDisagree? R:\tYeah. Well read the question again, just to make sure. I:\tI feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. R:\tI would say I disagree. Not strongly, but its just  I mean, case in point, theres  We all know its the way the system works, but theres time where justice and whats actually right has nothing to do with a dollar amount. And so in situations like that  You know, like my public defender was literally  She was up front. Just like, Look, youre case is equitable to this amount of money. You know, either through a civil lawsuit afterwards or this and/or this amount of taxpayers dollars that are being spent to come to court every fucking time or this, that and the other. So I would say I disagree somewhat. I:\tOkay. So you feel like the system isnt necessarily  R:\tNo. Its not working I:\tReflective of true justice or what you would consider justice? R:\tNo, no, of course not. I dont know any American probably that would answer yes to that. I:\tIf you dont mind me asking, does that factor into the way that you think about potentially working in law enforcement? I mean, that sounded like something you were interested in. How does that come into play when youre thinking about that? R:\tOh, its  This only reinforced  I mean, I could have taken it one of two ways. I could have been like, Oh, well now I should go be the good cop, you know, thats not doing shit like this. But in seeing my friend and knowing  seeing my friend growing up and then all my uncles that were  One was a DA agent who worked on outlaw motorcycle gang stuff. One worked for the FBI and then a couple others were just, you know, regular beat cops. So seeing the shit-show that they went through--pardon my French--it was like, I dont want go get [inaudible 78:07]. It completely changed my view on law enforcement. This reinforced what I already was kind of seeing with my friend and his change after taking [inaudible 78:19].  I:\tSo I have another statement. People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.  R:\tId say yeah  I mean, just because you cant have 18 million fucking people all wanting  just because they feel something  So I do think there is some sense of centralized law-making and whatnot that needs to exist. I just think that the system is so perverse now at this point that it does not work.  I:\tOkay. So another statement: Its difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tMe personally or the editorial like one?  I:\tIt can be you personally--how you feel about it personally. R:\tIts like somewhere in the middle. I mean, I think theres laws that are meant to broken. I think theres laws that are  Back to what I just said, I think theres laws that are meant to be upheld. I:\tThe law represents the values of the people in power rather than the values of people like [inaudible 79:22]. R:\tYes, I strongly agree with that. I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tYes, I strongly believe that. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tI think thats pretty evident. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tI would agree--or in the middle  I mean, I think its probably 50-50, you know. I:\tMost police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tNo. I:\tSomewhat disagree, strongly disagree? R:\tSomewhat disagree. I:\tThe basic rights of citizens in my city are well protected by the police. R:\t[Inaudible 80:06]. I:\tThe police in my city have too much power. R:\tUm  Id say somewhere in the middle. I:\tMost police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tOh yeah, for sure. I:\tAre there particular groups of people who you were like about? R:\tOh yeah, I mean its just general racism shit. Police race aside, I mean, you have  I have a little bit of an insiders point of view, I think, from all of my family that worked in it. But yeah, you see somebody in a nice  you see somebody coming out of the yacht club in a nice, new Mercedes and theyre clean cut and [inaudible 80:52], cops arent going to look twice at the guy. Even if hes  he can be shit-faced drunk and kill people down the road in his car. Theyre not going to give a shit or look that way. I know that sounds jaded, but it kind of is what it is. But yeah, if youre kind of scraggly looking, in some old clapped out pile of shit, theyre going to, Whats this asshole up to, you know? So that kind of thing.  I:\tSo have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened or abused or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police? R:\tYes.  I:\tI mean obviously, counting the arrest. It happened other times too? R:\tOh, yeah [inaudible 81:28]. Oh yeah, I mean I grew up in Vallejo, so  I:\tHow many times could you say this happened during your life? Like 1-5 times, 6-10 times, 11-20 times? R:\tProbably 1-5 times. I:\tWhen was the last time that it happened, if you remember? R:\tI was a senior in high school and I had a motorcycle--like a racing motorcycle. And so a cop stopped me just for no reason. You know, I even asked him, I said, Whats the nature of this stop? He was like, Dont you fucking worry about it. I was like, Im going to worry about it, because its not legal, you know. You have to have probable cause or an infraction that Ive done. And, you know, he detained me for a while--for like 20 minutes--just being a dick. And that was the end of that. Turned out it was because my uncle was the retired captain in Vallejo and he didnt like my uncle. He was just being an asshole. I:\tAnd he knew who you were? R:\tYep. I:\tAnd that was the last time that it happened? R:\tYeah, probably.  I:\tSo did most of these things happen when you were younger, then? R:\tYep. I:\tThat was about 16 years, you think? R:\t[Inaudible 82:41]. I:\tDid he end up letting you go? R:\t[Inaudible 82:47]. I:\tTo what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with police? R:\tSay it again? I:\tTo what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with police? R:\tUm  Oh, I mean, Im like  I think living in a city like Vallejo, which is  its had a lot of crime issues and theres a lot of preconceived notions about the city. I would say easily  To be blunt, Id say being white, male puts you at least one up on being a black male here because cops just regard  they can be kind of racist about shit like that. I would say then that it would change based upon what kind of car youre in, what are you wearing--you know, so that kind of stuff. But you feel like its giving you some kind of advantage in some interactions with police? R:\tOh yeah, you know  Id say so. Based on [inaudible 83:47]--yeah. I:\tIs there anything left out or [inaudible 83:50]? R:\tNo, not really. Its just is what it is, kind of thing. I:\tSo then the next set of questions are about your one arrest that led to a pretrial detention experience from the time you stopped waiting, before you knew what was going to happen with your case in jail. So you already told me about the circumstances leading to [inaudible 84:12]. And you were held for between three and four days, you said? R:\tYep. I:\tOkay. Im just going to put in three, but I have on the recording three to four. R:\tOh, no problem. I doubt its going to make a difference in [inaudible 84:27].  I:\tSo could you tell me what a typical day was like? I mean, you were having some pretty severe health issues. You were pretty badly beat up. R:\tYeah, basically they me a cell with this guy who was, for lack of better words, like bat-shit crazy. I think he was there on like 51/50. They put me in the cell  from my understanding it was to hide me away so that they could figure out what to do [inaudible 84:54] to OR. And I had no access to anything. Youre in the cell 23 hours in the day. They let you out for like 15 minutes to shower and whatnot.  I:\tDid they feed you? I mean, if you remember. You didnt eat for all those days? R:\tNope. I:\tWow--okay. R:\tBecause the one guy who was complaining about it. It was like, Yeah, shut the fuck up.  I:\tDid you have any water? R:\t[Inaudible 85:27]. I:\tOkay. What would you say  R:\tI think the one guy started drinking toilet water, actually. I:\tOh really? R:\tIm quite serious. I:\tYeah, thats a long period of time to be held without any food or water; without any care. What would you say [inaudible 85:45] you faced were on a day to day basis? R:\tI mean, you know, I was sitting there going, Oh my god, the reason was bullshit, and just here was my life before [inaudible 85:01] completely different and now Im a fucking felon, a convict, a prisoner; this, that and the other. So yeah, it was basically the biggest part was just kind of sitting there, shutting up and then when they kept coming into basically antagonize me and try to  Essentially what they do is they come in, they threaten you a few times and try to soften you up. Then they have the inspector come in and they try to get you on video saying you did whatever--whether or not its true. Then from that point of view its real easy. They just go, Oh, slam-dunk case, this guys guilty. [Inaudible 86:37]. The hardest part was probably just keeping mental clarity, which is why I think they didnt feed me or didnt give me water [inaudible 86:47]. Because they want you delirious, you know. Its like anything. If you want this result, these things make it easier to get said result, youre going to do these things. That was my perception of it. Thats what Ive been told.  I:\tAnd so no one was telling you like what was going to happen with your case? You didnt know if you were going to get charged with the felonies? R:\tThere was a guy that came  I said he kept coming in. I dont know who he was. And he was saying like, Oh, youre going to fucking prison, cock-sucker, you know, trying to scare me. Him I actually did tell him to go fuck himself. Pardon my French. I:\tLets see. Were there any informal rules of behavior that you like trying to observe or follow while you were being held? Do you feel like there were any sort of unwritten rules about managing conflict with guards or with the other cellmate or anything like that? R:\tUm  No, there was  And this guy opened up, I think, with that case where the one guard on the 850  There were a couple guards at 850 Bryant that were having guys fight each other. Im sure you read about that. Its been all over the news. Two guards got popped at 850 Bryant for  intake guys  And theyd get like a small guy they thought couldnt defend himself and was less aggressive, you know--whatever. And then theyd get a bunch of guys and have them pick fights and they would bet on them and these guys were literally  You can Google it. Its all over that. And these guys got  I think they get shit can and brought on some kind of charges for doing that. Its sick, I mean, you know, cock fighting with human beings.  I:\tAnd that was going on while you were being held? R:\tThere was inferences to it. So it was like  The same guy that kept coming in and talking shit, he was also like, Oh, we can make your life much friendlier here [inaudible 88:38]. Pardon my French, but Ill put you in with a bunch of fucking brothers, mother-fucker. Ill fuck you up, and this, that and the other. Go fuck yourself. I:\t[Inaudible 88:51]. R:\tYeah, it was  When they released me, I lived at 21st and Bryant. 850 Bryant obviously is where the station is. And they released me and so I literally got out and jogged all the way home. I grabbed one of my bikes, hopped on my bike and rode out to my fiancs. I was just like mentally just washed. You know, I absolutely was wiped. It went from a young guy out having a good time, drinking, watching his friends play music to all of a sudden, Oh fuck, now youre going to go to prison.  I:\tWere there any responsibilities or obligations on the outside during the time you were held that you couldnt fulfill because you were detained [inaudible 89:41]. R:\tYeah, Im sure. I had [inaudible 89:45] and shit and stuff. I think I may have  Yeah, I was working for Stephano [inaudible 89:52]. I:\tSo work? R:\tYeah, just general employment shit. You know, Hey, where the hell you at?  I:\tDid you make any arrangements so that those work responsibilities and other responsibilities were taken care of? R:\tYeah, my fianc, because they released her pretty much after  Took her in, drunk tanked her, and then they kicked her to the curb and that was that and then made all the paperwork pretty much go away. She called and said--oh yeah, I was in fucking jail.  I:\tSo were there any services or programs available to you while you were being detained in jail? It sounds like quite the opposite of that. R:\tThreat of another ass-whoopin.  I:\tWere there any services that werent offered to you but that you would have wanted to use if it had been offered? R:\tAt one point, the guy that was coming in and taking the OR interviews  So he comes in and he basically sits each person down, seeing if theyre applicable for OR [inaudible 91:03]. And the first time he came through they denied it to me. They said, Fuck you. Youre not getting that, again, because I was kind of in and out of it and stuff. The second time I think they guy must have somehow forced his way in or something--I dont know what. But the next thing you know, Im in this OR interview with this guy and the next day I got out. It would have been nice to have been ORed 48 hours sooner, which time allotments and  But it was obviously  the agenda was to try to lean on me to get me into the [inaudible 91:42]. I:\tIf youd been offered any kind of medical services, any like [inaudible 91:50]? R:\tOh yeah, yeah of course--yeah. I:\tOkay.  R:\tMe and my fucking face--my eye was swollen shut. You saw the pictures, so you know its one of those where its like  probably would have been nice to have had more than an eye stitched up and sent on my way. I:\tOkay, so if you family knew that youd been detained, how did they react to that? Did anyone in your family know besides your fianc? R:\tUm  Yeah, actually I think I had called my mom and told her, Oh, Im in jail. And her reaction was like, What the fuck are you doing in jail? I dont get in trouble with the law. Clearly just like  kind of indifferent. I dont know why youre in trouble, but  It was kind of the only person I could think of calling. I just called and said, Hey, Im in jail, in case some shit hits the fan, because I was kind of worried about the way it was going.  I:\tBut they didnt offer you any support or anything? R:\tNo.  I:\tDid that make you feel any particular way? Were you  R:\t No, I mean  29 years old and youre used to a similar dynamic. I:\tSo how important would a phone call  I take it you didnt have any visits from people. Were you able to make [inaudible 93:15] phone calls? R:\tI made one phone call when they still had me in the lower level. Soon as they ad seg-ed me, there was nothing. There was a guy coming in basically shit-talking me.  I:\tIf you were able to have access to a phone during that point, would you have wanted to use it? R:\tYep. I:\tWere there any people that you thought were going to try to contact you but didnt, while you were being held? R:\tUm  well, you know, my boss.  I:\tLets see  So as far as things that made it difficult to keep in touch with your family, including your fianc  Im going to read a list of things and you can tell me if they apply at all for reasons why it was difficult to stay in touch, so  R:\tShe didnt know. She was completely in the dark on what was going on with me. I:\tReally? Okay. R:\tAll she knew was, you know, Id been arrested. I think she had called up and they had said, Well, hes got like five felonies against him. [Inaudible 94:14]. And I think they even told her what the charges were and she was like, What the fuck? I:\tOkay. So she just had no way of getting in touch with you? R:\tNope, there was no way. She tried to. They said, No, hes in ad seg. I:\tSo you didnt have access to a phone for that [inaudible 94:39]? R:\tNope. I:\tAnd then she also didnt have any way to  They werent letting her contact you, either? R:\tNope. They told her that hes in ad seg. Shes like, Whats ad seg? Oh, its administrative segregation. She goes, Well why? We dont know. They basically just told her, You know, when he gets out or when he has access to a phone, youll hear from him.  I:\tSo you were eventually released from jail before a decision was made on the case, right--yes? You said it was on OR? R:\tCorrect. I:\tDo you know if there was a bail amount set? R:\tYou mean for initial? I:\tYep. R:\tThere was no information. There was just, There you go. They schlepped me up into a cell and they left you there. I:\tSo no one ever came to you and said like--were setting your bail at this amount or anything like that? No? Okay. R:\tThey said that maybe  One person also popped in saying something about, Maybe you two, me and the other guy and myself, will be an OR interview--an interview for OR to see you can get OR, and that was it. And then magically, though, the guy left and then I got stuck. I got left in there.  I:\tOkay, so it sounds like there wasnt a big, formal process for being released, then? You had an OR interview at some point. R:\t I had an OR interview and then probably less than 24 hours--the same evening--they called everybody out of their cells whos getting ORed. They trump you downstairs, do an outtake process and, Get the fuck out. I:\tOkay. Did anyone give you any advice, any resources, anything like that? R:\tYeah, yeah. Like I said, the intake guy is looking at me, he was looking at the charges, he was looking at me, looking at the charges and he kind of  I dont know why he chose  Maybe he sees this more frequent than we know about, but  He was actually pretty--from a humanistic point of view, he was pretty nice. He just said--he goes, Look man, youll probably be ORed in like  I:\tAnd that was at intake [inaudible 96:58]? R:\tIntake--yeah. I:\tOkay. When you were being released there, did anyone give you any kind of advice, any resources, anything like that? R:\tNope. They opened the door and they go, Get the fuck out of here. I:\tOkay. Were there any requirements for your release, aside from the court date? R:\tNope. There was, Show up to court by this date, or youre [inaudible 97:17].  I:\tDid you have any concerns, like on your mind, as you were preparing to be released in this pretrial period--so like before your court date? R:\tNo, by that point  I mean, like I said, Id been at least 72 hours without food, water and [inaudible 97:36] and being threatened with going to prison for four or five years. So I was just like, I dont care. I just want to get the fuck out of here. I:\tOkay. What did you do during the pretrial release period--so after this, before your first court date?  R:\tWhat did I do  I:\tLike did you just go home? You went to your fiancs? R:\tOh, I resumed my life. I:\tYou were working again in that period between  R:\tYeah, yeah. I think I took like a couple days off, you know  My fucking face looked like a piece of hamburger.  I:\tSo what sorts of negative consequences did you experience as a result of being held in pretrial detention? Did you lose your job? Did you still have your job? R:\tNo, still have my job, but it got very difficult, because I would have to take of work to go to the pretrial diversion classes and [inaudible 98:33] and all that shit. Im sure witnesses were questioned down the road [inaudible 98:40]. The whole system was just  I was appreciative [inaudible 98:45]. I was appreciative from a justice point of view [inaudible 98:53]. They used to get people that would [inaudible 99:03]. I dont know. I could look at it two ways, Oh, I dont have to waste my time, or What the fuck is the point of this?  I:\tYeah. I definitely will have more questions about that. Thank you for sharing that. R:\tThat person, I think, ended up getting like pulled off their duty for a while. Because then all of sudden they were shooting off and they were, Oh, we got to stay here, for one hour or two hours. It was a shit show for like [inaudible 99:41]. I:\tJust related to the period of detention--the time you were held in jail before this though--did you lose any kind of partner relationship because of that time? R:\tNo. I:\tLose a housing situation? R:\tNo. I:\tLose a car? R:\tTrying to think  Because my car died--this old 65 Volvo had gotten towed and then it  No, I didnt lose it, but I accrued a shit from the tickets and storage and stuff. I:\tOkay, so greater debt because of this period of detention? Okay. R:\tIt ended up being like 1,500 bucks just to get the thing back. I:\tOkay. So how was your experience in detention different from what you expected it to be? If you had expectations of what it was going to be like? R:\tIt fulfilled all of my expectations. I guess it was just like I guess an average Americans [inaudible 100:50] my age group, whatnot. And also [inaudible 100:53] what I know of law enforcement already leading up to it, so  I mean, it was almost storybook-like, you know, in terms of the shit you see in these movies  A guy comes in trying to lean on you and trying to get you to admit shit you didnt do. It was pretty cookie-cutter law enforcement type deal. I:\tOkay. R:\tUnfortunately. I:\tDo you feel like you were changed in any way by detention? R:\tUh  yeah.  I:\tHow so? R:\tMore cautious. You know, like I said, the responsibility factor of it where, you know, they could happened anyway. Yeah. But [inaudible 101:34] making sure that I was never drunk overly at all on the streets. I:\tOkay. R:\tIm a little bit more fearful of the law enforcement, you know  It was a shitty arrest. It was bullshit the way they handled it and attacking that coming out to tend to that kind of an issue--quote/unquote. And then their subsequent after hours in cuffs, you know. It was like  This really does happen, irregardless of race or anything. This does happen. I:\tOkay. Did anything good come from detention? R:\t[Inaudible 102:22]. I:\tOkay. R:\tMade me appreciative of not being in prison right now. Not [inaudible 102:28]. I:\tOkay. Is there anything youd like to add or talk about more about those experiences? R:\tIt was shitty. You know, it is what it is. I think its an unfortunate part of our system. It is what it is. I:\tSo this section is about the process by which you were assessed for the diversion program that you did participate in. So you did participate in a pretrial diversion program and lets see  How were you informed that you were being considered for pretrial diversion? Did you attorney tell you? Was it a judge in the courtroom?  R:\tYeah, the DA  Or not the DA  The public defender said, You can choose to fight it. And she was all hot and heavy wanting to fight it, because she was like young and just  typical things you hear about. But she was really, really not wanting me to take pretrial diversion, because the case was super solid, we had them on video, we had  This was all I did and then caught an ass-whippin and all these other way mishandling of it. So she wanted to  It was a juicy case for her. And I was like, Look, heres other factors going on here and I just cant do it. She was like, Look, you could do this and then after that you could sue them and make a bunch of money. She didnt exactly say that, but that was the gist of it. And so the whole way I pushed for pretrial diversion, just because I wanted it over and done with and [inaudible 103:53] my life and just to, you know, put it in the past. I:\tOkay, so your lawyer was helping you make sense of your options before you chose to do diversion? There were these factors [inaudible 104:07]. R:\tWhats that? I:\tI said there were these external factors though, where you were trying to keep in mind your [inaudible 104:13]. R:\tWell I was trying to make her understand that, Look, I understand you want to make a career for yourself and this is one big juicy step for you and a nice case for you, but at the same time its my life and Im going to have to be looking over my shoulder wondering--is this guy going to blow my head off, one; two, what consequences are going to happen for my friend because of his association with me? And so she wasnt like grasping that for a while and then she backed off eventually. I:\tSo an interview is usually conducted to determine if youre eligible for program participation. Did you experience any kind of interview to  R:\tNo, the very first hearing in front of a judge, she just made a motion at my request. She said retrial may be an option. It technically wasnt supposed to be because of the gun charge, I think, or something. [Inaudible 105:04] not supposed to be allowable for pretrial, but because they knew horseshit, the judges [inaudible 105:10].  I:\tOkay. R:\tIf this guys willing to do it, why are we going to waste taxpayers dollars and this is probably going to end bad for DA anyway, so  The DA was taking a hard line notion, because my understanding of what I was told is that the DA didnt want to back down from it because he  Any sign of weakness might instill me to pursue something. I:\tOkay. R:\tWhether that was true, I dont know.  I:\tOkay. So youve already described to me the factors that affected your decision to participate--that you wanted to be done, you felt fear of retribution if you pursued the case. Anything else affecting your decision to [inaudible 105:50]? R:\tNo. I:\tWere you ever aware of a level of risk assigned to you? Theres usually  like if there is an interview, its usually to determine your risk of reoffending, and so [inaudible 106:07]. R:\tNo, like a recidivism rate-type deal? I:\tYeah, to determine  yeah, yeah, that kind of thing. Were you ever aware of an interview conducted to determine [inaudible 106:14] level of risk? R:\tNo, it was pretty much just the judge [inaudible 106:17] said, Yeah, sure. Have a good day. I:\tOkay. Were you ever aware of an assessment made about your needs? Like any sort of assessment to connect you to services if you needed them, or anything like that? R:\tNo. I:\tSo how much did you feel that the program was going to help you to reduce your odds of reoffending, if at all? So not at all, some, quite a bit  R:\tNot at all. I:\tOkay, and was that because  I mean, you mentioned before that you felt like it wasnt  it was just kind of a  R:\tWell this wasnt  You know, I didnt have a history of getting in trouble with law enforcement. I wasnt a career criminal. So, you know, it was really bad circumstance got caught up; that was that. So I didnt think there was going to be an issue with that. The only thing that actually  Just to kind of [inaudible 107:11].  The only positive thing that came out of the pretrial trial--like they assigned anger management classes and stuff--was hearing other peoples stories. You know, the real intimate stuff youd hear from these other people that were in much worse situations than I was in. There was a lot of homeless people that were in there, a lot of substance abuse that was going on. And hearing some of the other peoples stories, that was kind of like  eye-opening. But besides from that, it was kind of a waste of time. The people leading the classes did nothing. They didnt care. They didnt want to be there. The one guy flat said, Im not going to be here in a month anyway, so sign your name and get the hell out of here.  I:\tSo do you know the name of the diversion program that you did participate in? I can read you a list and tell me if you hear the name.  R:\tIt was just  I made it a [inaudible 108:06].  I:\tSo was it called pretrial diversion? R:\tYeah, it was If you dont make us spend this much money in taxpayers dollars you can get the slap on the wrist and go away. I:\tOkay. Did it cost you anything to participate? Did you have to pay fees? R:\tYep. I:\tHow much? R:\tUh, it was like  I think like 120 or 160 bucks. I:\tOkay. R:\tThey go based upon your income, I think, if I remember right. I:\tOkay. Were you able to afford it? R:\tYep, yep. I:\tDo you know if it was waived or reduced to the low income status? R:\tNo, I dont think so. I:\tSo what were the conditions of your participation? You had to go to anger management course? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. How long? R:\tI had to fulfill a certain number of hours. And the hours were actually really low in comparison to anybody else in the class, so I was thankful for that. But it was  you have to be like 60 hours or 100 hours or whatever. You have to have progress reports, essentially, with the judge on a monthly basis--by a bimonthly basis. But other than that, its [inaudible 109:15].  I:\tSo somewhere between 50 and 100 hours? R:\tI think it was 60 hours.  I:\tWas there a specific number of months that you had to get it completed in? R:\tNo, it was like  I think it was dont kick the can down the road, but it was  I was never a set due date, like you have to have it done by this time. I think there was a certain point at which  because my work and everything was getting in the way. For like six weeks I just was not able to make the class because I couldnt take off from work just to go do this class and so  But I always called in and made sure that they knew, Hey look, I cant get off work, just to make sure I didnt get like a warrant issued, or anything like that. But I think at one point they said, Well, you know, try to complete it by this date. And I completed it and that was that. I:\tDo you know how long it would have been by that date? R:\tId say it took me six months to a year or something.  I:\tOkay. Ill just put six to twelve  But there wasnt really like a set  R:\tNo, no. I was actually kind of surprised. They had people in there that had like 2,000 hours they had to complete--Jesus Christ. I:\tDid the program do anything to address your needs? R:\tNo. I:\tNo extra services offered or anything? R:\t[Inaudible 110:37]. I:\tWas there any supervision involved  in the diversion itself? Like do you have any kind of supervision? R:\tWell the required anger management classes. They made you go to  There was a guy who would sit in there and was the leader of it--like a resource specialist or whatnot. The first two-thirds of my time there he just--sign the paper, go--leave. After a while he got in trouble and then he started making people talk and tell their feelings and this kind of stuff. I:\tBut no supervision out of the class? R:\tNope. I:\tDid you get any benefits from participating? R:\tAside from hearing other peoples hard-luck stories, no. I:\tHow do you feel like that benefitted you? R:\tJust made me more appreciative, you know, seeing  Not to sound callous, but if you see  You know, were kind of like the dregs of society and youre considered as such and youre like, Oh, my lifes not too bad, so [inaudible 111:38]. I:\tOkay. What if any negative consequences were associated with participation? So you mentioned it was tough with work? R:\tYeah, a couple times my boss was like a dick and you know, it was like, Hey  I:\tWas that when you were doing the mosaic  R:\tTerrazzo.  I:\tWere there other program participants that you got to know as a result of participating? R:\tNo.  I:\tNo? Did you mostly keep to yourself, of  R:\tYep. I:\tWas there a particular reason why? R:\tThere was some pretty sketchy seeming people in there, so  I:\tYou just didnt want to associate with them or talk to them necessarily? R:\tYeah, I mean, I didnt find any reason to strike up a relationship with any of them--no personal and professional reasons, like  If this is a singularity why Im here, these people are in there  a lot of them are there like just over and over and over again. I think thats why their hours they had to complete were so high. Why would I want to be associated with that? I:\tWere there any staff that you interacted with the most? R:\tThere was no staff [inaudible 112:51]. I:\tSound like there was very minimal staff involvement.  R:\tWell like I said, there was a guy that was there sometimes. Other times he wouldnt be there and they would just  A person would come in from somewhere and say, Oh well, so-and-so is not going to make it, but you guys still get credit, so have a good day. That would also happen frequently. I:\tDid that like lack of staff involvement affect your participation at all  your desire to participate? R:\tYeah, for a while it was like, you know, I was going kind of like just trying to hurry up and get it done with. And then once you start seeing the person thats supposed to be there not showing up and beyond not even lackadaisical, but just not doing the shit. Youre kind of like, What the fuck? Ive got off work, I got to take off my training, I got to take off all this stuff to come here and have some irresponsible asshole not living up to their end of the deal?  I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tNo. It was tough to hear some of the peoples stories, but  I:\tLike emotionally it was  R:\tYeah. There was once or twice I like teared up and just  seeing somebody just already broke and break down further. I was surprised at how intimate people who didnt know each other at all and at times were able to be with one another. That was kind of like refreshing.  I:\tSo then the next section is about any violations of program requirements. Did anyone ever accuse you of violating any program requirements? R:\tI think at one point when I wasnt able to make it for like six weeks, they were kind of like--oh well, blah, blah, blah. And then I think there was another time where my public defender had forgot her  She had told me I didnt need to come to one of the hearings and it turned out the guy said I did. So she said  I think there was like a warrant issued or they were threatening me with it. And of course I instantly [inaudible 114:55] and that was dealt with. She assumed responsibility for it.  I:\tOkay. So did anything come of the time when you couldnt make it for a while and they were kind of reprimanding you for that? Did anything come of that, or was that okay? R:\tNo, no. It was all threats of, Hey, try and hurry up and get me in and get me out. I:\tRight. Did you feel like there was a process in place that allowed you to advocate for yourself in this situation? Or was that just something you were taking [inaudible 115:25]? R:\tI mean, it was my choice to participate in the program, so there wasnt really much to talk about. It was just--I will get this done as per I can, you know? And so if I cant come here because Im going to lose my employment or some other issue, then its going to make me much more likely for you to see me again. I kind of vocalized that at one point and the judge said, Okay, no problem. I:\tOkay, so you feel like they were relatively understanding? R:\tBy and large they were very understanding. All the judges that I had were very understanding, I think, of the situation. I:\tOkay. Do you think that there was any extent that  or to any extent race or ethnicity shaped your violation experience? R:\tNo. As per related to the pretrial stuff, you mean? I:\tYeah and that kind of violation--when you couldnt make it for a while  [inaudible 116:25] of the judge? R:\tNo. I:\tSo then this section is about the end of your participation in the program. So what were you told you needed to do to complete the program successfully? R:\tPay the money and perform the number of hours.  I:\tOkay. Anything else? R:\t[Inaudible 116:38]. I:\tAnd you were able to meet the obligations? R:\tOh yeah, yeah. I:\tSo you did the classes, you did the number of hours and the court hearings and all that. Could you explain how the program ended? Was there any kind of graduation or did you have to get a certain number of like paperwork in or something like that? R:\tNo, it was just, Oh, this is your last class. Have a good day. I:\tOkay. Did you have to do any kind of follow-up with your public defender; coordinate any  R:\tI think I ended up having to because I think they ended up calling me back and saying, Oh, youre five hours short. And I said, Nah, nah  I had to go get a piece of paper that showed I completed it because [inaudible 117:20]. Aside from that, that got taken care of and that was it. I:\tOkay. And then as for your charges, were they then dismissed or dropped? R:\tYep. I:\tSo what extent do you agree with the following? Overall the program was very helpful. Strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. R:\tOh it was helpful in the sense that I didnt have to do a bunch of other potentially nasty stuff--to go trial, possibly have some guy wanting to kill me now because I took his job, or  So from that point of view, it was  Just for the pure end result of I didnt have to go to trial and its all done with, it worked well. I:\tOkay.  R:\tFrom the point of view that I didnt need anything else supplemental to that, no. It didnt do anything. I:\tOkay, so  Okay yeah, I understand what youre saying. So the class is itself completely unhelpful or counterproductive, but the experience of avoiding the alternatives was helpful for you? R:\tNo. I:\tWould you recommend program participation to other people? R:\tYeah--no--maybe. I:\tLike if they were in a similar situation to you, would you recommend? R:\tOh yeah, yeah. I:\tBut if they were and if they had maybe a better option to go to trial or something, would you still recommend it? Or like an option to go to trial without [inaudible 118:47]? R:\tIf my friend  I was at the point where it was just two things too many. So I could have dealt with a potential issue with this guy, but dealing with that issue and my friend in law enforcement and stunting his career was just a bridge too far. So if I wasnt friends with the guy in law enforcement that was working in the same place that  I probably would have [inaudible 119:18]. Because I feel that there was no actual justice done. If anything, it only reinforced that he could break the law, beat the shit out of somebody and he got away with it. Because the system [inaudible 119:30].  I:\tAre there any issues that you think require addressing in terms of how the program treats its clients and [inaudible 119:39].  R:\tYeah, I think it actually needs to do those things. I:\tSo you feel like the program didnt  R:\tIt was the bare minimum, you know, all these state-funded or county-funded programs was just  They dont give a shit about you really, but we save money by fulfilling these bare, base requirements. Id hate to wonder how many people that I was in those classes with are in the class still for separate offenses and new offenses and shit like that, because it doesnt address the problem. I:\tWhat do you think would need to change to make it more effective and address peoples needs better? R:\tProbably more interconnection. I mean, a lot of people seem to have like mental health issues that were either stemmed from substance abuse or exacerbated by substance abuse--tons of stuff. Just typical shit thats going on, you know, or in society right now. I:\tOkay. So you feel like if the program had connected people to more health services, mental health services, substance abuse services--that kind of thing? R:\tYeah, big time. There was people in there, like I said, that were kind of breaking down. There was one girl, she like broke down in tears and she obviously had some drug issues and stuff. But she was--you could tell--with it enough and was trying to make some kind of changes. But she kind of just needed like a fucking hand, you know. Or she just needed someone else to give a shit also. It looked like nobody did, so  I:\tSo do you feel like something like counseling services, like would that have been effective? R:\tI dont know. I dont work in the field, so its hard to  I:\tWell just totally from your observations. R:\tFrom my point of view, I think its a failure. I mean, you know, where do you start the conversation on that? You know, like the mental health wards that were closed so that then you have now  I mean, thats like 90 percent of the San Francisco homeless issue is [inaudible 121:30]. They were just thrown in the streets and theyre right on the fucking streets--multi-generationally now homeless with mental health issues and substance abuse issues. So its like at what point do you begin to address it? I think this program doesnt address any  isnt proactive in preventing the problem to begin with. This program just is, Oh this is a slap on the wrist because it saves us money, versus again, Lets do some preventative maintenance so that people dont get to this point in their life.  I:\tWhat kinds of preventative, like services would you say? R:\tYou know, just people giving a shit about other people, for lack of a better work and to put it tersely. People giving a shit about each other and  You know, personally I feel a lot of the systems we have in place right now are kind of perverse and they dont do anything to help people actually  Im not like saying conspiracy theory or that kind of shit or really paranoid, but its just I feel you have government and big money kind of do their thing and then you have everybody else just kind of hope you figure shit out and live your life and whatnot. And unfortunately for people that dont have any support systems, like case in point, I could have very easily gone down another road if I had let it get to me badly, because I dont have any support systems. You know, I could have very easily ended up the person strung out on drugs on the street, just going, Fuck it, you know, nobody cares. So I was fortunate in a lot of ways, but I think theres a lot of people that are not and I think the system overall is failing those people. I:\tDid the program create or deal with any challenges after participation? Did you feel that you had all the tools already yourself you needed to address your challenges? Or like any challenges that would come up? R:\tMy challenge was dont be intoxicated and loud in front of a SWAT team. That was pretty much my challenge.  I:\tDo you have access to people you can contact if you need help at this point? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. So you dont feel like supports would be in place if life got difficult for you right now? R:\tSupport systems within my personal life, or within this program? I:\t[Inaudible 123:57]. Do you feel like you have any support system when things get difficult? R:\tUh  Id say a little bit more than I did then, but no. I mean, Im pretty  kind of on my own.  I:\tDo you feel isolated [inaudible 124:10]? R:\tNo. I mean, I have good  I have friends at yacht clubs and different social strati and this shit, but  I wouldnt say I feel isolated. I just feel like, you know, the way I live my life is a little bit differently. So because of that, then its just a different set of rules, kind of, you know? I:\tDifferently, how? Like because of your specific kind of employment, or  R:\tIts either employment or just personal life choices, I mean. When I was younger, I had made really good money and I was making like 150-180K a year. It was like--oh, the American dream. Nice little Porsche and the shit that people covet. You know, it was kind of like, Okay, what is this doing to enrich my life [inaudible 12:08]. So I gave it all up and go race bicycles.  I:\tOkay. And you feel like that distances you from other people? R:\tI think it kind of created a situation which it makes it hard for  Case in point, if I talk to somebody who, you know, theyve only lived by the norm  Im not saying what that norm may be, but if theyre like, No, no, no, you cant go and do these  You cant think outside the box; you cant operate outside the box. You got to shut up, get your nine to five, have your white picket fence and so on and so forth. It can create a situation in which either side could not associate [inaudible 125:48]. I dont feel like Im some isolated, poor dreg of society. I just think I live differently and I try to live my life that way and so theres consequences--not consequences, but theres just different interactions.  I:\tThank you for sharing. So Im going to ask you some questions about your immediate experiences right after your release--after you were held in jail. So could you tell me about the day you were released? You said you were released in the middle of the night and you went to your fiancs and you were just really not feeling well after not having food or water. So I guess can you tell me about the following day? Like what did you and how were you feeling? R:\tI think I got up and made like a huge omelet, ate a bunch of food. And I think actually slept in, you know, like ridiculously late, to like noon or something. And then once I got up, an easy thing for me to always depend on was to hop on a bike and go train, because I spend so many hours doing it every day. So I hopped on my bike and went riding up to Mt. Tam and just kind of put stuff into perspective and get an idea of what was going on.  I:\tHow about the first week? R:\tIt was difficult. There were like weird things that were arising where  I dont know if you could attribute it like a PTSD kind of thing, just from the situation or whatnot. But there was kind of panic attack symptoms that Id never experienced or anything and were kind of seeming to come up. And after about three or four days, it all went away. I attributed it to just like a little PTSD, or anxious--whatever you want to call it. I:\tDo you feel like you still experience any PTSD from that experience today? R:\tI dont think so, but Im sure I have to in some way, shape or form. I:\tWhat was the toughest adjustment during the period of release--like immediately following release? R:\tProbably just resorting  I mean, Im not like a real  Im kind of like a big softy. Im like a real nice guy, I would say, in certain respects. And so for a while I was just, Oh fuck. People are out to hurt people like this? This is really shitty. Its one thing to have a misunderstanding. Its a whole other thing to have a misunderstanding and to be so malicious that youre going to send someone to fucking prison and ruin their lives just because you cant  And that to me--I thought that was sick. You know, thats pretty fucked up. I:\tOkay. What was the first month like after  R:\tPretty normal. The only thing that was weird about it was  Of course, like I said, my fucking  That took a while. That took like two weeks to go away and then everybody who knew me, just being like, Oh, Jesus. What the fuck happened? You know, because Im not one who gets in trouble with the law or any of that kind of stuff. So answering a lot of questions to people. I:\tOkay, about what happened? Okay. So Im going to ask you about different forms of assistance you may have received following your release. So right after your release, how were you supporting yourself financially? You were still working at your job? Okay. Any support from family or friends or anything like that? No? R:\tOne of my mentors who brought me up through the ranks in racing bikes, you know, he spent eight hours a day in a saddle, side-by-side with someone so you develop a [inaudible 129:51] relationship. You know, wed have conversations about it, this and that. He was kind of a  what you would categorize as like a hippie mentality kind of guy. So he was a little more understanding, I think, than someone maybe a little more conservative would be. I:\tSo he offered you some emotional support? R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. And actually I did forget about him, so that would have answered one of your earlier questions about another friend that would have  I:\tSo Im going to read you a list of control issues that you may have had and then Im going to ask you if you had any access to any kind of program or service to address that issue and if you did, if you used it. And this is right after release. And you can tell me if not applicable. So finding a place to live  Did you still have the same place to live  R:\tYeah. I:\tOr did you have access to a program to help you find  R:\tNo, we still had our house in the City.  I:\tOkay. Did you have access to any kind of program or service for finding a job? You didnt need it. R:\tNo. I think actually they did  I remember there was something that popped up in one of the anger management classes. Oh, if you need a job, heres a paper. Go get a job. I:\tOkay, but you didnt need to use it. Finding a means of transportation? R:\tNo. [Inaudible 131:07]. I:\tOkay. Continuing your education? Do have access to any kind of program or materials for that? R:\tUm  no, no. I am concerned now, though, that there are certain things that because of that situation--like A leads to B, leads to C, kind of thing  That if I do decide to go back to college that maybe there might be certain hang-ups with that. I dont know.  I:\tOh, because of your [inaudible 131:30]? R:\tYeah, right. I:\tAs far as I know, usually  R:\tNot just that, but also  I know youre going with it, but I mean also in terms of stuff that like  I dont know. I just dont know if theres anything that can arise from that later on, you know? Like Ive been told by this  My grandmother is Hawaiian [inaudible 131:56]. And so I was eligible for this thing called the [inaudible 132:02] scholarship and whatnot. And so Id heard that maybe there are certain things that can interfere with that. I dont know. I:\tAs far as I know, usually convictions [inaudible 132:13]. If you have [inaudible 132:14]. But I have heard people tell me that with specific jobs, even participating in some kind of diversion thing [inaudible 132:23] job application. But thats a very specific  R:\tWell I know for a fact if I apply to do a law enforcement job right now, it would pop up in the backgrounds and they would say, Okay, so you were [inaudible 132:36] or whatever, for these charges. And that could be a means for dismissing my--trying to apply for that. I:\tOkay, so then back to this list. Did you have access to any kind of programs or services for finding legal assistance after release?  R:\t[Inaudible 132:59]. I:\tGetting drug or alcohol treatment? Is that something that  not that you needed it, but were there  R:\tNo.  I:\tAccess to health care? Any kind of programs or services? R:\tNope. I:\tGetting counseling  including mental health? R:\tNo. I:\tGetting financial assistance? Any kind of programs to ?  R:\t[Inaudible 133:17]. I:\tObtaining photo ID? R:\tNope. I:\tWorking on personal relationships? R:\tNope. I:\tAny other issues that you were offered--programs or services? R:\t Nope. Like I said, they barely did, but they were supposed to, you know, so  I:\tAre there any programs that you wish were offered to you post-release that you would have wanted to use? R:\tUm  I dont know. Probably not. Put it this way. This interview with you-- and this is why I chose to do it--is more therapeutic than any of the stuff  and its probably more worthwhile than any of the stuff than I went through with the anger management classes or anything like that, so  I:\tIm glad to hear that this feels good to you--not glad that you didnt have that kind of support at that time. R:\tI understand--yeah. Just the ability to talk about it here is more than I was able to talk about it in class. And not by choice, it was just  it didnt come up. I:\tCould you tell me about your initial interactions with family members after you were released? Did you see your family in the time following release? R:\tNo. I:\tNo? Not at all? R:\tI think we had gone over to my fiancs familys house and they were actually like real  Her fathers actually  He can be a pretty nice guy and he was like, Oh wow, yeah it sucks. Im so sorry that happened to you. And he was pretty pissed off that, you know, his daughter got taken in in conjunction to this. Not because she actually did anything, but just because they had to stack it so that it looked correct on paper. He didnt appreciate that  you know, out of the system. So he was pretty upset about it.  I:\tHow did that make you feel? I mean, did you  R:\tI was indifferent to that. I mean, it is what it is.  I:\tOkay. Did the tension affect your relationship to family members at all? R:\tUm  no.  I:\tDid your family members provide any kind of support--any kind of emotional support? R:\tNo.  I:\tWere you surprised by that, or was that something that you were expecting? R:\t[Inaudible 135:37]. I:\tCould you tell me about initial interactions with friends after you were released? So like how did you feel with your friends right after  You mentioned you got kind of tired of explaining to people  R:\tYeah, well it was like it was a freak show, you know? It was like  It gets old. My friend, the one who works in law enforcement, he thought aspects of it were hilarious and not hilarious from being an unsympathetic point of view, but he was just like  Number one, he was like, Youre fucking lucky. He goes, They could have shot you. All kinds of shit that takes place that could have happened. It could have been much worse. He was very sympathetic about it. And obviously him working there and being able to joke with him about it kind of made it a little less  It took the sting off it a little bit.  I:\tAny other interactions with friends after release? R:\tNo, I mean, it was one of those things that I just didnt really talk about it much. Its like--oh yeah, this happened. Its unfortunate. Could be a lot worse. Lets move forward.  I:\tYou mentioned you talked [inaudible 136:53] more with your friend who was riding with you? R:\tCorrect--yeah.  I:\tDid detention affect your relationship with friends at all? R:\tNo. I:\tSo what kinds of support did your friend provide? Any emotional support? R:\tEmotional support--just the ability to  Like I said, pretty much what you and I are doing right now. Just the ability to talk about it; more feedback, obviously, but  I:\tOkay. You dont have any kids. So Im going to ask you some questions about your housing situation. So how many places did you live in the first year following that release? Were you living in the [inaudible 137:36]? R:\tNo, no, no. We had housing still in San Francisco--yeah. Shortly after--probably six months later is when that ended. But it wasnt due to  It was just San Francisco.  I:\tRight. But how many places did you end up living that year following release? So you were in the apartment and then you were in the van moving around and then from there were you  moved to Vallejo? R:\tYeah, I moved to  I bought the boat  moved to Vallejo. We lived on that for about a year--a little less than a year. I:\tOkay. Was that  Did you move within that year after being released? R:\tNo, no, no. I think that was  Because this happened  I forgot the date of this, but this happened and then it was like two--Id say two or three years later, you know. I:\tOkay, so you were living two places in the year following release--so your apartment and then the boat? R:\tYeah, thats probably accurate. I:\tSo how would you describe your housing situation immediately following release--like right after release? Were you living in your own house or apartment? Were you living with family members, house or apartment, a friends house or apartment, residential treatment facility, transitional housing? R:\tNo, no, no. We were renting an apartment over by SF State. I:\tOkay, so it was your own  R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay, could you describe the pros and cons of that living situation--that apartment? R:\tIt was cheap for San Francisco standards--it was ridiculously cheap. It was rent controlled. It was great placement for what I was doing. Both my employment at the time was kind of in the Sunset and Outer Richmond area a lot. So it was perfect for that. Id hop on my bike. You know, 25 minutes I was over the bridge, so it was very cozy. I:\tOkay. Anything bad about it--any cons? R:\tLoud college kids.  I:\tOkay. How would you describe your housing situation today--live in your own house or apartment? R:\tI rent a place over there.  I:\tCould you describe the pros and cons of your living situation right now--your [inaudible 140:00]? R:\tKnock on wood. No, no complaints. I have a 50 foot by 50 foot shop, full tilt. You know, a shop that anything I want in it. I got a full yard with which to work on the boats and Ive got a loft, you know--pretty much it. Not much complaining there. I:\tLets see. So since your release--since that release a couple years ago--have you had trouble finding a place to live due to contact with criminal justice system? Has that ever been a factor? R:\tNo.  I:\tSo Im going to read you some statements that describe how you feel about your neighborhood, both immediately following your release, so when you were living in the apartment in San Francisco and then also your neighborhood today. So you can strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree. So this is about your neighborhood immediately following release--so San Francisco: My first month out, I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live. R:\tYep.  I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYeah. I:\tIn my first month out, it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. I:\tDisagree? In my first month out, I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tLaw enforcement--yeah. I:\tIn my first month out, drug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tHuh  I mean, its SF State, but I mean  I:\tBut not like a serious drug  R:\tYou mean me? I:\tI just mean like in your neighborhood. Was it  R:\tNah. I mean there was some shit-heads that were selling drugs, but its like stupid frat boys, you know. I:\tSo it didnt feel like a serious problem to you? R:\tNo, it was not a fear of violent crime from these guys. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tYeah. I:\tI cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions. R:\tYes. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, the people who lived there could get it resolved. R:\tYeah, sort of  yeah, probably. I:\tAgree? I expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tNo. I knew the writing was on the wall with San Francisco, where they were just evicting people and whatnot--irregardless of rent control. It doesnt work.  I:\tOkay. So then this is about  These statements are about your neighborhood today--so where you live right now. My neighborhood is a safe place to live. R:\tEh  sort of.  I:\tSo neither agree nor disagree, or agree? R:\tWell its in the unincorporated area out here. There are  you know, hear shots all the time. There are  theres break-ins and stuff. Just because its so remote by Vallejo--city standards, but Id say somewhere in middle.  I:\tOkay. Its hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood.  R:\tYeah. I:\tDisagree? Im nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tNo.  I:\tDrug selling is a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tYeah.  I:\tI think my neighborhood is a good place to live. R:\tSituationally, yeah. I:\tI care about what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIf theres a problem in neighborhood, the people who live there can get it solved. R:\tYes. I:\tI expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tSure--yeah. I:\tOkay. Were almost done. So with regard to housing, what are your future goals and how do you plan to achieve them? R:\tUh  I dont know. I have an option to either buy a subdivision of the property in this neighborhood  build a house on it, retain the shop--do that. Or buy a house here in Vallejo, because its still so dirt cheap. Thats an option. Or relocate. Ive also thought about going back to the City. So [inaudible 144:02]. I:\tOkay. So potentially building or buying a house in the future? R:\tYep. I:\tIs there like a certain  Like would you have to save a certain amount of money or is there like plans that would go along with  R:\tYeah, it would just be accruing about 150K of just capital just to be able to throw at it.  I:\tLets see. With regard to where you live, what are your future goals? Youd consider moving back to San Francisco at some point? R:\tThere are certain things that are attractive, you know. Its a nice place to live. Anything you want is there--that kind of thing. Theres a lot more--theres better food, theres better culture. Probably a lot safer than Vallejo by and large--as Vallejo is right now. I have a lot of my old contacts and just your local coffee shops and just little shit like that. So from that point of view, its appealing. But the cost is pretty much the only [inaudible 145:03] thing. I:\tWhat would you have to do  R:\tWin the lottery. I mean, over there  To buy a house over there, theres nothing less than pretty much a million dollars, that you can touch, so that requires a lot more capital. I:\tRight--okay. R:\tId have to sell and restore a lot of boats. I:\tYeah. Do you think its a possibility, though? R:\tUh, not with the current climate and then also with what Im doing right now. If I wanted to go back and do terrazzo, yeah, I could do it. I:\tIs there anything youd like to add or talk about more about housing? R:\tUh  yeah, it sucks in the Bay Area.  I:\tYeah, as far as rent, prices--that kind of thing? R:\tWell, its just  The Bay Area is  I dont know if youre from here, or  Yeah, you know, its just a lot of people moving in. Housing is ridiculous and shows no signs of stopping yet, so that makes it  You know, when I first moved to San Francisco, the beauty of it was it was still kind of cheap. You could get an apartment for like 1,200 bucks a month, you know, which was ridiculously low. You could live in a cute neighborhood. People were kind of doing the whole bohemian, you know, [inaudible 146:17] kind of thing. It was a great place to be when youre in your 20s doing that kind thing. I was there broke--starting, but making my way--bike racer and so  You know, you cant do that now. It doesnt exist. So the paths with which you can take in the City are very narrow--typical things that everybodys talking about right now.  I:\tThank you for sharing. So Im going to ask you some questions about your employment situation since that release. So you still had a job immediately following release, right? R:\tOh yeah. I:\tThat was the mosaic  I:\tAnd you said that your title there was Terrazzo  R:\tTerrazzo mechanic/fabricator/illustration  whatever the hell you want to call it. I:\tOkay. And you already told me you started that job  I already have information about that job. Im just going to skip over those questions because you already told me about that job.  R:\tYoure doing pretty good. You havent had to write anything down on that one.  I:\t[Inaudible 147:56]. When did that one end again? R:\tUh  I quit that about, I dont know, six months after I moved back to Vallejo. I:\tOkay. When was that? R:\tIve been here for  Ive been here for going on two years, I think.  I:\tOkay, so like a year and a half ago, so like  R:\tSomewhere thereabouts. Im sorry  I quit that a year in June 6th.  I:\tOkay, so a year ago? R:\tJune 6th was when I quit. So this last June 6th it was a year. I:\tOkay. And then after your release, did you search for work during periods when you didnt have a job, or were you constantly employed? R:\tI always had a job. I:\tOkay. R:\tAlways had employment.  I:\tSo you didnt have to spend any time like searching for work, or if you knew what you were doing? R:\tIf I wanted to work, I always had work.  I:\tOkay. All right, Ill skip those questions then. The kind of work you do, youre not like submitting applications and stuff, so its kind of irrelevant.  R:\tNo, you pretty much make a phone call or somebody phone-calls you. I:\tOkay, so to what extent do you agree with the following statement: Having a criminal record has made it very difficult for me to find work. Strongly agree, agree  R:\tDisagree. I:\tBecause you dont have a record  R:\tRight.  I:\tOkay. You did mention, though, that you feel like if you were to try to go the law enforcement route again then that would come up and be an issue.  R:\tI will not, but I know for a fact it would be brought up. I know for a fact it could be used against me. I:\tRight. So thats not something youre interested in anymore because of your experiences with  R:\tWhats that? I:\tThats not something youre interested in anymore though, because of your experiences with  R:\tNot just because of the experiences with this, but because  I:\tWatching your friend? R:\tWell I know that in general, you know. Theres a lot easier ways to make money than doing that.  I:\tWhere do you see yourself in terms of work and employment in the next year, the next five years, the next ten years? R:\tJust growing this old restoration business that I have; seeing what that does. Basically I just use it to network within the racing community; within the sailing in general and some other stuff. You know, just kind of trying to remain dynamic and something pops up [inaudible 150:45].  I:\tOkay. Is there anything else youd like to add or talk about any more about that? R:\t[Inaudible 150:51]. I:\tSo the next set of questions is about your financial situation right after release. Did you incur any debt related to your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tUh  I guess there was some parking tickets and bullshit like that.  I:\tOkay. Would you consider that debt that youd accrued, or  R:\tYeah. I:\tSo if you could tell me the type and amount of financial obligations related to criminal justice contact. So did you ever have any restitution orders? R:\tNo. I:\tAny fines? R:\tI dont think so. I:\tCourt fees? R:\tI think there were court fees and there were  I:\tDo you remember how much the court fees were? R:\t[Inaudible 151:40]. I:\tOkay. Ill just put  R:\t[Inaudible 151:42] tally it all up and basically the whole thing cost me about like 1,500 bucks.  I:\tOkay. All right, any surcharges--felony charges or anything [inaudible 151:52]?  R:\t[Inaudible 151:53]. I:\tNope? Any parole or probation fees--you didnt have parole or probation. R:\tNo. I:\tSo there were other fees and you said that in total it came out to be like 1,500 dollars? R:\tYeah, with all the shit that happened. And like I said, you know, having to go get the car out [inaudible 152:10] and pay parking tickets and blah, blah, blah and all that kind of bullshit. It ended up being about 1,500 bucks [inaudible 152:16]. I:\tOkay, Im just going to put  Yeah, I put 200 for court fees and I put 1,300 for other fees. R:\tMiscellaneous--yeah. I:\tOkay. Have you ever experienced any of the following because of criminal justice debt? Have you ever been to court because of debt related to criminal justice obligations?  R:\tNo. I dont think so. I:\tBeen re-incarcerated, had a violation recorded, had a drivers license revoked, had wages garnished? No? Had a lien placed on your assets? Had contact with the IRS? No? Had one or more accounts frozen? Credit score been affected? No? Difficulty getting credit cards or loans or anything? R:\tNope. I:\tAny other consequences because of  R:\tFinancially, no.  I:\tOkay. In general, how would you say that criminal justice obligations have affected your life? R:\tIn what way? I:\tIt could be like with regard to employment, relationships  just time, money--anything like that. Like just how has it affected your life? R:\tUm  You know, like I said, it made for some stressful days here and there until it was completed. Thats probably pretty much it.  I:\tIs there anything else youd like to add or talk about more? R:\t[Inaudible 153:52]. I:\tSo is there anything else thats important to you or going on in your life right now that we havent covered? R:\t Not thats pertinent to this, no. I:\tDo you have any questions for me? R:\t[Inaudible 154:16]. I:\tIf youre thinking about this interview and this process and youre like  I really want to know something about it that you didnt think to ask, you can also contact me. R:\tThank you. I:\tIf something comes up. R:\tThank you. I:\tSome of the things that we talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable topics. Were there any topics or questions that you felt like were particularly uncomfortable and concerning? R:\tNo. I:\tLets see. So to get in touch with you for further questions if necessary, Im going to ask for contact information from family members or friends that are close to you. Just in case your phone number changes or  If something happens where we absolutely cant get in touch with you  R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tAnd well keep this contact information confidential. And also, nothing that weve talked about in your interview would [inaudible 155:02].  R:\tI understand.  I:\tSo is there a contact? R:\tYeah. [Gives information] I:\tOkay, is there a family member, another friend, or [inaudible 155:54]? R:\tNo, probably not.  I:\tShes the best person? R:\tYeah. [End of SF283]    SF283\t\tPage 59   \n",
      " R:\tSo, sign again. I:\tThats not for you, yeah; thats just for the person I turn it into. R:\tOkay, okay. I:\tSo, heres your money--$10, $20, $30, $35, $40. R:\tI cant believe youre giving me money for this. I:\tWell, we appreciate your participation. R:\tYoure the one that deserves the money. What I deserve is money from the city for what theyve done to me, but they dont--thats the whole deal. Thats what this whole things about, yeah. They dont want lawsuits. At first, I thought that they didnt want the public to know whats really going on, okay? That was my first thought. And then I realized that the public doesnt give a rats ass. They could care fucking les. They dont even want to hear about it; it might ruin their nice day, okay? The thing is, they dont want lawsuits, after lawsuits, after lawsuits, after lawsuits to make the police pay for their crimes. Thats what they dont want, because the city would be bankrupt, okay? Thats what the whole things about, you know. I thought at first that it was about the public didnt want to know. But thats not really what its about. Its about the lawsuits. They dont want to be sued. They would be sued so many times, the city would be bankrupt 10 times over, okay? And theyve got all their bases covered. Theyre professionals. They do this every day and every night. They know exactly what theyre doing. They have all their bases covered. In other words, the police dont police themselves, because they have a code, okay? Well turn our heads and look the other way, just like we want you to do if we fuck up. Turn your head and look the other way. And if somebody comes around asking questions, lie to protect the police. I:\tSo, are you speaking from your personal experiences here? R:\tYes, I am. See, thats the thing. Nobody can take this away from you. When it happens to you, it happened. You put Barack Obama in this chair, Ill bury the piece of shit. Ill bury him. Ill put him in his place. He wont know whether to fucking shit or go blind, okay, because thats the real world, you know, that everybody avoids, okay? They dont want to know, okay? I:\tWith that introduction there--which I appreciate your insights in--we have to continue with the beginning of the interview here. R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. I:\tSo, theres just a series of questions that well go through. R:\tYes, yes, yes. I:\tAnd Ill ask your opinions on them. R:\tYes, yes. I:\tAnd feel free to elaborate on any. And if you would like to stop at any time ... R:\tOkay, I know the whole deal inside and out. When it happens to you, it happened to you. You know. Nobody else knows. You do. They can never take that away from you. They cant. I:\tOkay, so the first set of questions is about your current circumstances in life. Basically, they have to do with your background, relationships, and experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. R:\tOh, Jesus, thats going to take forever right there. Go ahead. I:\tHow old are you? R:\tSixty-four. Ill be 65 in January. Yep, Im an old geezer. I:\tAnd when were you born? R:\tJanuary 5, 1952. Thats when the UFOs flew over the White House. Do you know that? I:\tI havent heard that before. R:\tOh, you didnt know. No, people dont. Yeah, they flew over in formation over the White House in 1952. How about them apples? Yeah, they sent fighter jets up, and they split. And then the fighter jets landed, and they came back again, right in front of everybody in the goddamn country. They dont talk about that. Thats what this whole things about. America talks about what America wants to talk about, and just sweeps everything else under the rug. How do you like that? Wake up. I:\tWell, this is why we have to get insights from people like you with experience in the criminal justice system. R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Thats why Im here. I:\tAnd where were you born? R:\tSan Francisco, California. My mother and father were born here. My familys been here for well over 100 years. I:\tWow. R:\tYep, thats right. I:\tSo, youre a US citizen? R:\tDuh. I wish I was another citizen of somewhere else, to be honest. I:\tAnd what is your gender? R:\tMale, duh. Do I look--what? I:\tWell, theres a lot of options that you can choose for their gender. Thats why we ask. R:\tOh, Jesus. Oh, thats sick. Okay. I:\tPeople that choose to self-identify in different ways, you know. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tSo, how would you describe your ethnicity and race? R:\tMy race? Im a piece of garbage. Im an old white guy. Im on the bottom of the totem pole. Im not a woman. Im not a minority. Im not gay. Im not any of this crap. Im just an old piece of crap, and Im not even a geek, okay? Im the bottom, the bottom of the totem pole. Im a piece of garbage. Any other questions? I:\tIm sorry that you feel that way. R:\tNo, thats the way it is. Its not that I feel that way. Its ... I:\tI dont think anyones a piece of garbage, though. R:\tWell, thats the way it is. I:\tI think everyone has a lot to offer in different ways. R:\tThats true. Thats what you think, but nobody else gives a rats ass, okay? I:\tSo, other people view you as white, as well? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd what is your present marital status? R:\tI was actually married at one time, and my wife and me--she wanted to bring her family over from Mexico. And so we got divorced, because I didnt want to live in El Paso, Texas. And she did. And I was not going to live in--but she was a great gal. [NAME] is her name, and she was a really nice gal. And Ive had girlfriends before that and after that, but nobody wants a piece of garbage, so thats what I am now. I would never get a date. I:\tWhat about children? Do you have any children? R:\tNo. I find that life can be a gift, or it could be a curse. And for me, it was a curse. And I didnt want to bring anybody into this nightmare. Thats what it is to me. I cant help it, okay? I:\tAnd what about the highest level of education youve completed? R:\tI just got a GED diploma, because I worked. I worked since ever I was this high. I had paper routes, three of them. And then when I went to school, I was on a work program. Our family didnt have any money. The church supported us. We didnt have enough. So, I worked my whole life, doing whatever I had to do, you know. Ive worked a lot of jobs. I:\tAnd what do you currently work as? R:\tI dont, because nobody will hire me, because Im an old piece of shit. I found that out when I was 50 years old. I went to every place I could go. I did everything I could do, and nobody would hire me, because they would rather hire a 20-year-old than a 50-year-old; just age discrimination up the wazoo. And thats when I was 50, let alone now--65, okay? I could get work if I left town, but I dont have the money to leave town and get to move to somewhere else, see, where they would hire me. But I could get work if I could leave the city. I:\tSo, if you dont work, how do you support yourself financially currently? R:\tWell, I was on SSI. I was on food stamps and GA because my mother had a stroke. She was going to give me the money to move up north and get a job and a place, but she had a stroke. So, since when she had her stroke, I had to file for food stamps and GA--and then GA wanted me to apply for SSI, which I did. And SSI is the biggest rape in the history of this country. Theyre the most dysfunctional program there is on the planet. But they did save my life. And so my mother just passed away. And Im going to inherit some money. I didnt know there was any inheritance, okay? And I just got a thing in the mail saying Im going to get $100,000. I:\tWow, thats a lot of money. R:\tYeah, its enough to put a down payment on something or buy half of a car or something. Im going to get this money in December. And so Im going to get off of SSI. As soon as I get this money, youre off, okay? And so thats it. Thats what I have to live on, until the lucky day comes when I croak and join all the bitter people that Ive ever met that are in the next world. I:\tAnd how much money do you earn? R:\tI dont earn any. I:\tYou said that you received $100,000 ... R:\tIm getting SSI and Social Security, okay? And Im going to lose SSI when I get this money. And Social Security is going to be cut in half because I have to go on Medicare. Im on Medi-Cal right now. Medi-Cals free; Medicare isnt. But when you turn 65 in this free country, you have to get Medicare, and you have to pay every month. Medi-Cal, you dont have to pay nothing. So, Im going to get on Medicare on December and lose SSI and lose Medi-Cal. So, Ill be on my own. I:\tSo, theres no amount currently before you lose it that you earn? R:\tNo. Nobody will hire me. Maybe if I wouldve learned how to geek out, I couldve gotten a job around here, maybe, but I:\tWhat do you mean by geek out? R:\tBe a computer person. This shit--I dont do this. I dont need this. Ive never needed this. Everybody else I know has cell phones, and computers, and all these devices. I dont need any of this. Its meaningless to me. I:\tSo, you dont have a cell phone? R:\tNo, I have a landline. You talk about a caveman--youre talking to it. I:\tSo, the next set of questions is about relationships and social support--basically how you may feel about your current relationships with your family. Family means blood or legal relatives. R:\tWell, my family used to be really close. Im close to two of my sisters--that are the only two people that really care if Im dead or alive. And theyre the ones that helped me when I was backed into a corner. And Ive paid them back. And the rest of the family--not much. I mean, when we see each other, were, you know, friendly, but its all bullshit. Its not real. But I have two sisters that really care about me, and I care about them. I would do anything for them at any time--anything. I:\tSo, in terms of a general strongly agree to strongly disagree range, how close would you say that you feel to your family? R:\tPretty close, pretty close. I:\tSo, you would say thats an agree, or a neutral, or a strongly agree? R:\tAn agree--not strongly, because, you know, most of my family are Americans. Theyre brain-dead. Theyre brainwashed. Theyre out of touch. Theyre out of tune, okay? But theyre my family. But I dont associate with them or deal with them--only two of my sisters. I:\tWith what would you say theyre out of touch with? R:\tReality; they live in cyberspace. Theyre Americans. They live in denial. They wont admit nothing. Thats how Americans live with themselves; they just deny everything. How else could they? They just deny everything. I:\tLike denying what, for example? R:\tHow rotten this country is, how corrupt it is--completely and totally--how rotten. You think the police are the heroes? Theyre the sickest pieces of fucking scum, fucking shit that God ever created. They aint the good guys, man. These guys are fucked up. I dont know how they are anywhere else, but I know how they are here. I was born and raised here. Ive been arrested three times in my life, all by total psycho, complete lunatics from Central Station--all from the same station. Isnt that something? And I would like to write a book about it. I think it would be the most fascinating book about it. But anyway, yeah. I:\tWell, well get into more questions and details about the arrests in some of the later questions, but right now, were just going to hammer through these background questions to understand where youre coming from. R:\tThe background stuff, I wasnt ready for, but thats okay. I:\tHow would you respond, from strongly agree to strongly disagree, that you want your family to be involved in your life? R:\tI would love my family to be involved in my life. I:\tSo, strongly agree? R:\tYes. Of course. Theyre my family, you know. Your familys your family. Thats all you got, really, unless your familys fucked. Then thats different, I guess. I:\tWhat about, I consider myself a source of support for my family? R:\tNo. Well, my sisters did help me when I was backed into a corner. I:\tDid you help them, though, or ... R:\tI would do anything. I paid them back for whatever they gave me, and they know that I would do anything for them--anything for them, okay? I:\tSo, you would say strongly agree? R:\tTheyre the most special people that I know, that I have. I:\tWow, thats precious right there. R:\tWell, thats what it is. I mean, you know. I:\tWell, what about agree or strongly agree for that question? So, you would say that for the question, I consider myself a source of support for my family - you said you would do anything ... R:\tOh no, no, no. I dont support my family; my family supports me. I:\tSo, you would say strongly disagree or disagree to that question? R:\tWell, Im not sure how to answer that. I mean, I just inherited $100,000, okay? So, I mean, you know, theyre supporting me. Theyre giving me my share of, you know, the familys money. I:\tWhat about how you support them? Do you feel like you support them? R:\tI do, but the thing is, its kind of a tricky question, because I support the people that supported me. But the other ones that didnt give a shit if I was dead, or alive, or what happened to me at all--I dont support them. And it was really hard to deal with that. It took me years thinking about this, because I wouldve done anything for my family. But after what happened, and after the way that they treated me when all this stuff happened, I realized that they didnt give a shit if I was fucking dead or alive, man. They didnt. And as sick as it sounds, I dont care about them, either, you know. They didnt give a shit. They didnt give a crap about me. And my two sisters did. And of course, I care about them. But the rest of the family just didnt care at all. And so to be honest--I know this sounds sick, and it is sick, but thats the way it is. I:\tSo, you would say agree to that question, just for our records, you know? Got to get it down. R:\tOh boy, whats the question again? I:\tThat you consider yourself a source of support for your family. R:\tNo, I dont support my family. I:\tDisagree? R:\tYes. I would, but I dont have to. I:\tSo, for, Your family is a source of support, you would agree or strongly agree to that, based on what you said? R:\tWell, theyre giving me my share of inheritance. So, I guess thats my support. I mean, thats what Im going to be living on from now on. I:\tSo, you would say strongly agree? R:\tI would have to, I guess, whether I want to or not. I mean, what would you say if they gave you $100,000? I:\tI would say strongly agree. Thats quite a bit of money. R:\tOkay, there you go. I:\tAt least for financial support. What about, I fight a lot with my family members? R:\tNo. I:\tSo, you strongly disagree or disagree to that? R:\tTotally, completely disagree. I dont fight with them. I:\tWhat about, I often feel like I disappoint my family? R:\tThats kind of a trick question. Whats that question again? I:\tI often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tWell, maybe. You know, Im not a doctor, or a lawyer, or a dentist, or a bullshit artist--which everybody loves, you see. Im a real person. I did real work my life. And I got nothing but the finger for it. But anyway  I dont know how to answer that question. I:\tWhat about, I am criticized a lot by my family? R:\tIm not sure. I dont know. I:\tNeutral? R:\tYeah, I dont know what they think about me. I:\tSo, heres some more specific statements on a similar set of questions. I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk. R:\tDefinitely. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd how many of those people would you say? R:\tWell, two of my sisters. One of them, she calls me. She lives in Idaho. And she wants me to move up there. And she calls me every week, and talks to me every week. And shes my sunshine. And then I have another sister thats a geek who lives in Palo Alto. I dont talk to her every week; I just talk to her once in a while. But shes just precious. Shes like a saint. Shes just so--special person. And shes had a lot of bad things happen to her. And so I have two sisters that--they care about me. I:\tI have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem. R:\tYes, my sisters. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYes. I:\tSo, its the same two? R:\tYes. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live. R:\tWell, my sister in Idaho wants to help me do that. The other ones just--theyre oblivious to my situation, really. But my sister in Idaho--she wants me to move up there and get a place up there. Its kind of different up there. Its really different. The weathers really different. Its really strange. I:\tIf youre interested, we have resources available in a list form for housing within the Bay Area, and I could send that to you after this interview. R:\tOh, really? I:\tYeah. R:\tYeah, I would like that. I:\tAll right; for sure. Let me write it down. R:\tOkay. I live in this place up here. Its just a few blocks away. And Ive lived there for 40 years, man. And its rent control, okay? And if I give up that place, Im screwed if something doesnt work out. And Im not going to sleep in a doorway, okay? Im not going to live homeless. Im not going to sleep in a truck, okay? I just cant do that. I cant do that. I:\tWell, I hope some of the resources that I send you will be useful. R:\tOh, I think anything would be useful. I:\tWould you like me to mail those to you, or R:\tYes. Do you have my address? I:\tWe dont have your address, but I can write it down. I can also send it via email if you use email. R:\tI dont do that stuff, see. I have a phone and an address. Its usually good for most people. They could call you up, but theyre so impersonal, they would rather email you. And its like, yeah, thats cute, but call me up, you fucking idiot. I:\tAll right; great. So, back to these questions. So, you would say theres one person--and you would strongly agree or agree on that question for the person in your family--the sister you mentioned who could help you find a place to live? R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYes. I:\tHow about, I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job? R:\tNo, they cant help me at all, but they would if they could. But they cant. They cant make somebody hire me. I:\tSo, you would say strongly disagree--zero? R:\tId just have to disagree. But they would if they could, see. Some of these questions are kind ofyou know. I:\tYeah, we just try to get a thorough background on the people were interviewing, to understand where theyre coming from. R:\tYeah, okay, okay, okay, okay. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tNot really. When Im sick, Im on my own, man. I mean, my sister that would help me is in Idaho, for craps sakes. And then my other sisters in Palo Alto, and shes got a thousand things on her plate. But she would if she had to. I:\tSo, you would say that you disagree with that question. R:\tIm not sure what to say about that. I:\tOkay, Ill put not applicable/not available. I have someone in my family who will provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed. R:\tNo, nope. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tIm on my own. Im on my own. I have to walk or take the bus--or call a cab, if its an emergency. I cant keep a car, because your cars going to be gone when you go out to these places. I live in hell. My car was stolen. My roommates car was stolen. My next roommates car was stolen, okay? I:\tWow. R:\tYeah, right. You think this is cutesie-tootsie? Think again. Its as far from cutesie-tootsie as it gets. Yeah, right. The place is a hellhole. I would do anything to get out of here. Even though I was born and raised here--and I love the weather. Whenever I leave the city, the only thing I miss is the weather--fresh, cool air, sea breeze, fog. I love it. I love it. I:\tWhat about, I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support? R:\tWell, yeah. My two sisters would if they could. I:\tSo, agree, you would say? R:\tYes. They helped me out when I was backed into a--I paid them back, but they did help me out. I:\tSo, family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also sometimes influence us to do things that are not in our best interests and be sources of stress. Can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends that provide good examples of both good--which was supportive--and bad, destructive, or stressful influences on your life? R:\tNo, theyve never done anything to stress me out. Well, none of them are destructive. I have two sisters that support me, but nobody does anything against me--nothing like that. I:\tAnd you spoke a little bit about how your sisters have been supportive. So, the next set of questions is about your relationships to people outside of your family. Can you talk about the three people whom you feel closest to personally, like friends? R:\tNo, theyre all dead, or they moved away, or they were fake friends. I dont have a friend left. The last friend that I had, he just died. And the other friend that I had just died. And theres nobody to replace these people, okay? The new generationIm sorry. This is nothing personal, okay? Theyre just disrespectful, worthless bags of snot, okay? They dont have any respect. They dont care about the real world. Theyre geeks. And its very disappointing to see what its come to. Its very disappointing. It was different for me. When I was a kid, we respected older people. We loved them, okay? Now its completely different. Its a different world. Its night and day. Its just night and day. When I grew up, we didnt even have TV, okay? Hello? You talk about different. It was a different world, completely the opposite of what its turned into. So, in a way, Im glad that I was here to see it all happen. But it happened, and you have to deal with it, right? I:\tGenerational shift. R:\tEverything just changed. People changed. Everything changed, okay? Moms used to stay at home and take care of you. And they cooked. And they sewed. And its all different now. Everythings different. Its night and day from what it used to be. But thats what it is. We got to deal with it. Everythings just changed. Its night and day. You know, computers were unheard of unless you watched some sci-fi, you know, cartoon on TV. There was no such thing. This stuff just came on like gangbusters. So, anyway, yeah, its a different world than it was, completely opposite. But like I said, we have to deal with it, you know. Its got to be dealt with. You have to change, whether you want to or not. I:\tIts true. So, the next set of questions are about groups and organizations that you may be a part of, and if you receive any material or emotional support from them. R:\tNo. I:\tWell, Ill just go through the list, and you can let me know. Maybe there might be some, perhaps. So, what about a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? R:\tIm a spiritual person, but I hate religion. I:\tSo, you would say no? R:\tI hate religion, just like I hate politics. The two most evil things that there are on the planet are religion and politics, okay? I:\tWhat about a recreational club? Are you a member of one? R:\tWell, no, but, I mean, I used to. Theres some good things about the church. They bring communities together, okay? That kind of stuff is beautiful. And they help people that are disadvantaged--because when I grew up, we had nothing. The church gave us Christmas presents. And my mother was in the hospital for a long time. And so the church really helped us out. But as far as the religion part goes, its all bullshit. Its all bullshit. I:\tWhat about a recreational club? Are you a member of any recreational clubs? R:\tNo, not now. I mean, when I was a kid, I was, but not now. I:\tHow about a sports team? R:\tI love sports. I:\tAre you a member of a sports team? R:\tIm 65. For Gods sakes, no. But, I mean, I played sports my whole life, and I love sports. The Indians beat the Cubs last year. It was very disappointing, but tonights another night. Well see what happens. But I love sports. It takes my mind off of everything else. I:\tWhat about a music or artist group? R:\tThe Who is my favorite rock-n-roll band. I love music so much. But like everything else, I cant play music in my apartment. The neighbors are going to bang on the wall, okay? You cant. But I love music, and I have an acoustic guitar that I play when Im not feeling horrible. I play acoustic. I love music. I:\tDo you play with a group or by yourself? R:\tI would rather play with a group, but I play by myself. I used to play drums with a group. I:\tHow long ago was that? R:\tOh, that was quite a while ago, because you cant play drums anywhere. I:\tHow many years would you say? R:\tTry playing drums in your apartment, and see how long it takes for the police to come and kick down your door. I would say 10 minutes, okay? You cant. I:\tHow long ago was that, would you say? R:\tOh, this was quite a while ago. I:\tMore than 10 years, less than 10 years? R:\tOh, yeah, more than 10 years ago. Yeah, everythings changed. You used to be able to have a garage band. Now its unheard of. You go to jail. I:\tWhat about a crew or a gang? Are you a member of any of those? R:\tWhat, a gang? No. I:\tOr a crew? No? R:\tNot at all. I:\tHow about local government? R:\tI washed my hands of the whole thing--complete no. I:\tWhat about any civic associations? R:\tNope. I:\tAnd a support group? R:\tNope. I:\tAny others that you might want to mention? So, now were going to talk about your employment history a little bit. R:\tOh, Jesus. I:\tYou said that you were three years old when you had your first job; is that correct? R:\tI always had to work. My family didnt have any money, okay? So, I had paper routes. When I went to school, I was on a work program. When I got out of school, Ive had job, after job, after job, after job, after job, after job. And the good places that I worked, they all went out of business. Everything changed. Its all different. Its night and day. I:\tWhat were some of those good places that you worked? R:\tA machine shop; I worked ship repair. I:\tCould you tell me about those two; what made them good? R:\tI worked at a boatyard. I restored jukeboxes. I dont know if you know what a jukebox is. Theyre ancient history now, but when I was a kid, if you had a jukebox, you were the coolest fuck on the fucking planet, man, you know. Its all changed. But I restored jukeboxes; worked at a boatyard; ship repair; mechanic. I was a mailman when I was young. I delivered flowers. That was a trip. What a job that is. I drove taxi at night for 15 years in this fucking godforsaken place. You talk about a bunch of fucking freaks, man--15 years at night, okay, night shift. Ive done a lot of work at a lot of jobs. And most of all the places that I worked have gone out of business. Theyre gone. San Francisco--its just a dump. I:\tSo, could you tell me, what made some of those good work experiences good? What about them did you like? R:\tBecause I liked the work, and I liked the people. And they liked me. And they treated me good, because they knew I was going to show up every day, and give them an honest days work as you could possibly get, okay? And they treated me good, and I appreciated that. And when they went out of business, I was crushed. I was just stunned. I couldnt do anything about it. They all closed down. My father worked at [NAME]. That was one of my first jobs. That place has shut down. Its gone. Its been gone for decades, okay? Everythings changed. I:\tWhat did you do after the place shut down? R:\tFought for another job. I:\tAnd that was the taxi cab job? R:\tNo, whatever at the time, you know. The taxi cab--I started driving when I was 25 until I was 40, okay? And I had life before taxi and life after taxi. And the life after taxi were the good jobs that I had. And all of those places went out of business. Theyre gone. The rent here, everything--they just left. I:\tIts very expensive. R:\tThey just left or went out of business, because times change, and everything had changed. I:\tSo, as far as how much of your adult life that youve been employed, would you say all of it, most of it? R:\tMost of it, I guess. It was over 10 years ago when the last place I worked at shut down and went out of business. And I was never able to get another job. I:\tHow old were you then? R:\tI was 55. I:\tWhat about skills that you bring to the labor market? What are some of those, and how did you learn them? R:\tI show up on time every day, and I could do just about any job. Id pick it up, and do an outstanding job. Anywhere Ive ever worked, you ask anybody else that I ever worked for, and theyll tell you the same thing. He showed up every day, on time, and did an outstanding job. And Im proud of that. I:\tIn case the recorder didnt capture it earlier, can you name some of those jobs that you thought were good for you? R:\tOh, the good jobs were ship work. I liked ship work. Boat work was really challenging. Restoring jukeboxes--once I got the hang of it, I was very comfortable with that. And machine shops--you make parts--mill machines, lathe machines, okay, you make parts out of metal or plastic. You make parts, okay? You drill threads into them. Its all down to the 1/1000s of an inch, okay? I have a tool at home that measures down to 1/1000 of an inch, okay? You got to make these parts right. If you dont make them right--theres a tolerance, they call it. If its over 5/1000, its garbage. So, it better be 5/1000 of an inch, or its garbage, okay? But its a beautiful job, and its inside. In other words, it could be pouring rain, and youre working. I did carpentry work and stuff like outdoor work. When it rained, it screwed everything up, okay? But machine shopping and jukebox restoration was all indoors, so it didnt matter what the weather was like; you could go to work, and it was beautiful. I:\tSo, what barriers to employment have you had--things that have prevented you from being employed, you would say? R:\tMy age; age discrimination is rampant. Its the most cruelest thing thats ever happened. And now Im a non-geek. I mean, I could pick it up, you know. If somebody showed me, you know, how to do it, I would pick it up immediately. But nobodys here to show me or help me out with these kinds of things. And so ... I:\tSo, this is something that you would like to learn? R:\tNot really. I like to do real work. I dont like sitting in front of a goddamn fucking computer. Im sorry. I dont call that work; I call that whatever it is. But I like doing real work. I like repairing things, fixing things, yard work, whatever--that kind of work, okay? I:\tAre you interested in working still? R:\tWell, I think it would be a really good thing for me. But like I said, nobody wants me. I:\tWould you like us to pass along some employment resources to you, as well, [00:44:40 crosstalk]? R:\tWell, you could. Ive been down the road. Before I packed my computer up and put it in the closet, I tried to look for work online, and it was a nightmare. It was just torture. It was unbelievable. And I would get through this step, and I couldnt do the next step. And oh, it was just horrible. It was just horrible. It was horrible. And I guess me and computers dont seem to like each other. Me and HAL dont get along. I:\tSo, you would say one ... R:\tDo you know what Im talking about, HAL? I:\tIts a reference to the movie. R:\t2000--yeah, okay. I:\tSo, you would say that a lack of technological knowledge is one of the barriers? R:\tYes. But like I said, its not rocket science. I could pick it up if somebody were to show me how to do it, you know. Its not that hard to do, really. I:\tSo, where did you last work? R:\tMy last job was, I delivered flowers. I:\tWas there a company of the company? R:\t[NAME]. And its since gone out of business, of course. When I first drove flower deliveries, I was 16 years old. And it was [NAME]. And [NAME] was our big enemy. And I ended up driving for [NAME], delivering flowers. Oh, boy, Im telling you, I could talk about delivering flowers, man. I:\tAnd your job title was flower deliverer? R:\tYes. I:\tWhen did you begin that job? R:\tI got the ad out of the newspaper. And the guy was the son of the boss that I worked for when I was 16. As soon as I mentioned his father, and told him I worked for his father, boom. He hired me immediately. And it was part-time, but then he kept firing drivers. And it ended up being fulltime, and then they went out of business. He sold the whole business. I:\tWhat month is that that you started? R:\tOh, Jesus, man, I dont know, man. I dont know. I:\tWhat about year? Any estimate on the year? R:\tIts about 25 years ago--24, 25, something like that. I had pushed 50. I think I was around 50 at the time, yeah. I:\tSo, you would say around 1990, 1991? R:\tAnd I only worked for a few years before they went out of business. And since then, nobody would hire me--not in the city. In other words, I went up north to visit a friend, and I could have got a job up there. They wouldve hired me. But I couldnt move. I didnt have a car. I didnt have money at the time. I wasnt in the position to move. But they wouldve hired me, unlike here. And the women up there were a lot more friendly than the women here, okay? Theyre very nice. Oh, boy. I:\tSo, the place of work closed, you said. Thats why you lost that job? R:\tNot really. Actually, the boss fired me. And when he fired me, everybody else quit, because he fucked up. He shouldnt have fired me at all. I was the best driver they had, and they all knew it. The boss was sick, and he got divorced, lost everything, and sold the business, okay? The guy went off the deep end; thats what happened. I was just a victim. And everybody got fired. In fact, as it turned out, as I heard later, they all sued the boss for what he did to them. I didnt sue him, but I:\tIn case the recorder didnt capture it earlier, could you describe the jobs that youve had in the past briefly, again, other than the taxi cab driving job? R:\tI delivered flowers. I:\tWhat else? R:\tBefore that, I restored jukeboxes. And before that, I worked at a boatyard, [NAME], okay? I worked at [NAME]. And before that, I did machine shopping. I made parts at different machine shops. They all have gone out of business and closed down, okay, because, like everything else, it turned into a computerized business. I:\tHow was the flower delivery job different from those jobs that you just mentioned? R:\tThe flower delivery was funny, because ... I:\tWas it different, would you say? R:\tIt was different because when I drove taxi, people would say, oh, you must really know this city. Ill tell you a secret: Cab drivers dont know jack shit. They dont know the city at all. Flower deliveries--you know the city. Its completely different. In other words, you go to [NAME] to visit somebody, a patient, you go to the main hospital. Theres 20 buildings over there, at least 20 buildings. Same with [NAME]. You go to [NAME], theres 20-something buildings up there, 25 buildings. You go to a college campus, you go over to [NAME], its acres, and acres, and acres. When you deliver flowers, you have to go to all these places. Its unbelievable. Its unbelievable. Flower deliveries are the people who know the city. Cab drivers dont know jack shit. They know where the airport is or where the hotel or the restaurant is, but flower deliveries--you deliver flowers to the hotels and restaurants, and you deliver them to every part of the city--every part that you could ever imagine. Thats where you go. Its just completely different than cab driving, completely different. Its amazing. Its amazing. I:\tWhat about the amounts of money youve earned through these jobs? Have they been smaller, or ... R:\tNo, I just never got paid really much. I:\tWhat do you consider much? R:\tNot much at all, you know. Shitty pay. Benefits were important because I always got dental, and I always had my teeth fixed. But since I havent worked or have dental, my teeth are going away. But the pay was just minimal. I:\tLike minimum wage, you would say? R:\tWell, a little over minimum, but not much, not much at all. And then I had some bosses that appreciated what I did and gave me extra money and stuff like that, because they liked my work, and they liked that I was there. And so they treated me really good. I:\tCould you tell me about some of your positive work experiences, your most positive one in particular? What made it positive? R:\tWell, I mean, I liked the machine shop work very much, making parts, because it was a challenge, and it had to be exact. Like I said, 1/1000 of an inch. Do you know how big--okay. But jukebox restorations are really--once I got the hang of it, I loved it, because once you did the machine, you had to test it out for days. So, I could play all these great tunes. Oh, it was beautiful. I love music, okay? So, I would just play tunes and make sure everything was correct, okay? And it had to be tested out. And it was indoor work, just like machine shop. It was indoors, you know. Try working on boats when its pouring rain. Good luck--or even ship work. Everythings soaked. Everythings wet. Your tools are wet. Everythings a nightmare. So, indoor work was really special for me. I:\tCould you tell me about your most negative work experience and what made it negative? R:\tBoy, I didnt expect all these questions, to be honest. I:\tRemember, we can take a break, or stop at any time, or you dont have to answer any question that you feel uncomfortable about. R:\tNot really. To me, a job was a job. I guess the most negative was driving a taxi and hauling pieces of human shit around. Oh, you meet so many interesting people--yeah, sure--bunch of scumbags. Interesting people, my ass. I:\tIs there anything else that you would like to add or talk about more related to that series of questions? R:\tNo. I cant believe youre asking me all this stuff, but thats okay. I:\tWhat about substance abuse? So ... R:\tOh, boy, Ive abused it. Well, right now, Im basically abusing alcohol a little bit. I mean, I always drank, you know, but Im just so depressed. And I smoke tobacco. And I always smoked weed my whole life, but now I dont smoke much at all. And then I used to take psychedelics when I was young, of course. Everybody did, you know--LSD, magic mushrooms, things like that. And I stopped taking those drugs because life turned ugly, and ... I:\tWhy do you say life turned ugly? R:\tLife turned ugly, okay? So, when youre high and everythings ugly, thats not good. Thats not good. You dont want to get high. So, I stopped all the psychedelics years ago, even magic mushrooms. I had friends that grew magic mushrooms. I stopped taking all of that stuff. And when my mother had a stroke, I stopped smoking weed, because I couldnt afford it. And everybody thought, gee, [NAME] doesnt have weed. Oh, hes going to go crazy. It didnt bother me. I was surprised, too. But I did start abusing alcohol, you know--not just drinking like normal people. You know, you come home from work, you have a drink, you eat your dinner, you have a glass. No, I dont have a job. So, thats a problem that Ive been dealing with, because I know its a problem. And I dont want to abuse alcohol, okay? So, Im trying to be careful and deal with that, okay? I:\tHow old were you when you first started using drugs and/or alcohol? R:\tOh, Jesus, a young teenager. I mean, I dont know--14, 15. And Ive been smoking cigarettes my whole life. I:\tHave you ever received treatment for a drinking or a drug problem? R:\tNo, no. I:\tSo, you said you felt like you have a drinking problem now. Do you want to talk about that a little bit more, or? R:\tNot really, you know. I mean, I can take it or leave it. In other words, if I had a job, I would be like everybody else. I would go to work. I would come home from work. And then Id have a few beers--or if it was a bad day, maybe a martini or something, okay, like the rest of the world. But when you dont have a job, and you hate everybody, and you hate everything, you want to start drinking right away, because what else is there? And Ive dealt with it. Ive dealt with it as good as I could. AA has been suggested, and I dont need AA. So, yeah, things just turned the way they did. And Im not crazy about the idea, and I think a job would be a good thing for me. I think what I need to do is get out of this place. As much as I love the weather, I hate it. I was born and raised here. My folks were born and raised here. San Francisco used to be a great city, and now its a stinking, filthy dump. I:\tWhat would you do if you left? What are some goals that you might have for yourself? R:\tOh, well, I was hoping to move up north, like in Humboldt County, so I could grow my own legally. I:\tGrow your own cannabis? R:\tYeah. And then I met people that would hire me, and theres also Indian casinos up there. Ive worked in casinos before in Lake Tahoe--one of my many jobs. And working in casinos--they never close, ever. Theyre open 24 hours a day every fucking day, okay? So, theres three shifts a day for all jobs. And they dont pay much. So, its a job that youre not going to get paid much, but you can get a job. And they wouldve hired me to do one of--they had a whole list of jobs--you know, security, restaurant part, this part, that part. And then the other people--I met some people that had pot farms, and they would hire you for a certain period of time--for a few months out of the year--and pay you really good to trim and clean their plants and stuff like that. And then other people wouldve hired me. I had all these job offers. Man, I was getting all geared up to move up there. And then my ma had a stroke, and I didnt get any money. And I was hung out to dry, like Ive always been my whole life. I just got hung out to dry. I was all ready to get up, and giddy-up, and go. And I had three jobs lined up--not here, but up there, in Ukiah. Its up in Humboldt County. I:\tIs there anything else that you would like to add or talk about more relating to the substance abuse questions? R:\tWell, I dont like abusing anything. Ive been struggling to not abuse alcohol, because I like to drink--like most people--but I dont like to abuse it. Thats not good. Its just unhealthy, okay? So ... I:\tWould you like any resources from us on perhaps how to ... R:\tNo, these are my own demons that, you know, Ive been working on myself, you know. As long as you know and relate to it, thats the important thing, you know. In other words, I dont deny it or whatever. I:\tSo, now Im going to ask you about your mental and emotional health. Have you ever been told by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or psychiatric nurse, that you had a mental or emotional condition, or that you showed symptoms of one? R:\tNo. But I did go. Theres a place two blocks away, over here on Filbert Street. And I went there because I was applying for SSI, and they told me to go to this place. Its a clinic. And I had a psychologist and a therapist. So, you have to have both of those. So, I went to them, and they couldnt help me at all. In fact, they needed a therapist and a psychologist, okay? I:\tDid they tell you that ... R:\tI dont know how they get their diplomas. Man, Im telling you something. This getting your diploma online and stuff like that--these people are idiots. Theyre brain-dead. I dont know how they got their diplomas, but anyway. I did go there, and they couldnt help me at all. I knew they couldnt. But as it turned out I:\tSo, did they tell you that you showed symptoms of an emotional or mental condition? R:\tNo, they tried to give me medication to help me sleep and to help me feel better. And none of it worked. And I stopped going there. I said, I dont need this crap; its not helping me at all. I didnt want to go there, but as it turned out, it helped me get on SSI, because I had to go to court to get on SSI. And when I went to court, and the judge heard that I went to this place, it gave me credibility, see. But they couldnt help me at all. I:\tHave you ever thought that you might have an emotional or mental health condition that was not diagnosed? R:\tWell, its just depression. I:\tCould you tell me a little bit about that? R:\tIm depressed. I hate everything. I hate everybody. I mean, everythings fucked up. Everybodys full of shit. And Im talking Americans. In other words, theyre all real nice people that would never hurt anybody. Theyre assholes. Theyre self-centered, greedy pieces of shit. And theyre phonies. Theyre fakes. Theyre hypocrites. Theyre going to vote for Hillary Clinton. I mean, for Gods sakes, man. I mean, theyre sick, okay? And Im stuck around a bunch of pieces of shit. And as far as all these geeks--nothing personal--they can take their devices and shove it up their fucking wahoos, okay? I dont need that shit. In other words, to them, I dont have a life, because I dont have all these devices. So, Im just a meaningless piece of caveman shit, okay? To me, they dont have a life. If this is your life, you dont have a life. Youre toast, okay? I live in the real world, okay? Its different. Its simple. Thats the part that kills me. Its all simple. Its all very simple. But its all being confused and turned into this. And people are teaching their children. This is the most worthless piece of shit company. They make garbage--[NAME]. I would never buy anything [NAME]. You know, to them, Im just a caveman, a piece of shit. But to me, theyre just brain-dead, little geeky bags of snot that dont know their ass from their elbow unless they have this to tell them, see. I:\tHave you ever taken any medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor? R:\tI did, and it didnt work at all. I stopped right away. I:\tWas this for the insomnia that you were speaking of? R:\tFor insomnia and depression, and none of it worked. And I stopped right away. I said, this is not getting it done. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental hospital unit, treatment program where you stayed overnight because of an emotional or mental health condition? R:\tYes. Yeah, thats what happened. Thats why Im here. I:\tYou were there overnight? R:\tI was there overnight, at [NAME], because this fucking, stinking, badge-wearing piece of shit fucking hauled me away. He kidnapped me. He tortured me. And he sent me up the river. And he got away with it, because he had a badge to hide behind, okay? Thats why Im here to talk to you. All of this shit means nothing. Im here to tell you whats going on and what happened to me. This fucking stupid fucking brain-dead fucking badge-wearing sack of fucking shit--and I ended up in the psych ward at [NAME]. And I woke up the next day; I didnt know where I was, of course, because I was whacked out on--I was unconscious. And they let me out the next day, of course, you know. But I did spend the night there. I:\tCould you talk about this more in detail? When exactly did this happen? R:\t2012. I:\tAnd this is the incident that you got pretrial diversion for? R:\tIm not sure, because, okay, Ive been arrested three times. The first time was by a psycho lunatic when I drove taxi. I:\tHow old were you then? R:\tI was in my late 20s. And he hated cab drivers. And he arrested me and anybody else that was driving a cab. This guy was whacked out. And the thing is, we were all taken in a paddy-wagon down to the Hall of Justice and strip-searched, bend over and spread em searched. But at the time, I had a father, and he come and immediately bailed me out. And we went to court the next day. And they just let everybody go, because--and then the same fucking piece of lunatic fuck tried to fuck me again. It was about a year later. I:\tSame cop? R:\tSame cop. And he tried to fuck me again. And he told me to drive my cab to Central Station, and park it, and go inside. And I parked my cab, and I went inside. And the cops said, what happened? And I told them what happened. And heres the funny thing. They said, just forget about it. Go get in your cab, and go back to work, and forget this ever happened, okay? In other words, everybody in the department knew that this guy was whacked out--everybody. But they dont get rid of them. Theyre still out there. Thats the thing about this whole thing. These cops--theyre the sickest, theyre the most fucked-up pieces of shit. And theyre protected. Theyre still out there. They wont get rid of them. They wont retire them. They wont put them behind a desk. They let them stay out there, okay? Thats the problem. This guy was a known lunatic. And the last thing I heard about that freak was, I read something in the paper one day--that he went up to Knob Hill one Sunday morning and wrote 200 parking tickets on Knob Hill. These are doctors and lawyers. That was it for him. They finally took him off the street after that, you know. You can fuck with cab drivers, but you dont fuck with doctors and lawyers. So, he was the first guy. Then in 2005, I went out to a place down here one night, like I used to do. And I ran into living hell. And thats where I learned about the police. And this officer didnt like me. And they had this act where if they dont like you, they pin you down on the cement and beat the shit out of you. Yeah. How do you like that? I:\tCould you tell me exactly what happened, from start to finish? R:\tWell, I could, but its going to take all afternoon, okay? And then the last thing--the one that I think youre talking about--happened right up in my apartment. I:\tIn 2012? R:\t2012. That was a real good one. Its another great story. I could sit here and tell you for an hour how that nightmare went down. It could only happen to one person that I know, and thats me. It was just unbelievable. And it confirmed everything that I have learned about the police in the 2005 nightmare. That opened Pandoras Box, okay? I learned about the whole department, about everybody associated with the police. The police that assaulted me were the tip of an iceberg--just the tip of an iceberg, okay? The whole iceberg was, everybody associated with the police department, in any way, shape, or form, are guilty. Theyre as guilty as the cops that beat me up, because they protect them. They make sure that they get away with it. They turn their heads and look the other way. People are treated worse than any animals. Thats a fact. I was beaten up. I was bleeding. They didnt even tell me there was a nurse. They just put me in the cell. I had no rights. The second that this fucking piece of fucking cop--that bastard decided he didnt like me, that was it; my whole life was over. And then the 2012 thing was a situation that--thats the thing I was telling the people at this clinic that I went to. I was telling them, I live in a horrible situation. I said, my neighbors are psychos. The landlord died, and his son is running the show, and his sons a piece of shit. And Im surrounded. And I have a roommate thats an asshole. And I just want to die. I live in hell. And finally, the whole thing caved in one day. And I was asleep when the whole thing went down. I had a neighbor next door, a psycho bitch from hell. This gal is the filthiest psycho on the planet. I think shes on medication now, but she wasnt at the time. And she just used to have conniptions. And usually, my roommates werent here when she did. They went to the Art Institute. They were at school or working. They werent there. But this one time, it was a roommate that I didnt know. He hadnt been there long. Hes a real creepy fuck. And what happened is, the bitch went crazy. I was asleep. I was out like a light. I hadnt slept in days. And I was asleep. And I woke up to this screaming, and screaming, and screaming. And I got up, and my roommate and her were screaming at each other. And she called the police on him. And I dont know what she told them, but the police showed up. And my roommate was gone. He left. I dont know if he had a warrant on him or what. I didnt even know the police were there. My room is in the back of the apartment. I could take you up there and show you. And anyway, they blamed everything on me. I was asleep. I:\tWhat did they blame on you, exactly? R:\tThe whole thing--all the screaming and yelling. She told the police that I had been screaming and yelling for hours. I didnt scream and yell at all; I was asleep. But the police didnt know that, because they have shit, okay? Thats what they have for brains. In other words, the guy upstairs that was partly responsible for the whole thing--I had called the police. I had filed a police report against this guy. He threatened me with a butcher knife. He threatened me with a stun gun. This guy belonged in an asylum. But when the police showed up, he didnt answer the door with a stun gun or a butcher knife; he got a cane. Hes not crippled. And he has also a blind cane. Hes not blind, okay? But when the police come over, he answers the--and they go, oh, hes just a poor, sick, old man. How easy it is to fool them, right? If you show up, theres a butcher knife at your throat. If the police show up, hes got a cane. I:\tSo, can you describe the exact arrest experience? What was said to you? Were you read your rights? R:\tI never had any rights. Okay, heres what happened. They got into the screaming match. I woke up. I went out and said something. The landlords son, whos a piece of shit--he lives in Bakersfield. And he had just come up here the next day. His apartments right next to mine. So, I knew he was there, because I had heard him the night before. So, when all this yelling and shit went down, I went and rang his bell, and said, you know, hey, man, do something, you fucking idiot. And he didnt do anything. He was over there pissing in his panties. He didnt do nothing. He told the police that he wasnt there. He was there the whole time. How do you like that, okay? And so what happened was, the guy upstairs, the lunatic with the butcher knife and the stun gun, had palled up with the psycho bitch, okay? So, what happened was, he hadnt complained when she had her conniption because hes pals with her. And he didnt do anything. And then when I got up, and woke up, and saw this whole nightmare, okay, he screamed at me. He said, youre a fucking drug addict. And I thought, why is he screaming at me? Because hes fucked up. I:\tThis is the cop, youre saying? R:\tNo, this was the neighbor upstairs. I:\tOr the neighbor upstairs. R:\tYeah. So, I went upstairs. I wasnt even awake. I was half-asleep. And I went upstairs to tell him to shut the fuck up, and why is he calling me a fucking drug addict, the fucking piece of shit? I dont have any drugs--because hes sick, okay, and I already reported this guy repeatedly to the police, who did nothing about him. Anyway, so I went up there. And I saw him in his kitchen, and I hit the window with the back of my hand when I gave him the finger. And the window broke. It was a very thin pane of glass, okay, number one. Number two, I wasnt even awake, you know. It was a complete accident, okay? But on the other hand, he had no reason. Why is he yelling at me? I was asleep. I didnt start any of this. I didnt have jack shit to do with it. Hes yelling at me because he didnt like me. The reason he didnt like me is because he always wanted to be my pal, and I didnt want to be his pal, see. So, he took this into a whole--anyway. So, I broke the window. So, he came charging out on his back porch with a stun gun and tried to zap me with a stun gun. I was just on the stairs. And then I got down into my apartment, and there was blood coming out of me. And as it turned out--I didnt find this out for weeks later--he had a butcher knife in his other hand. I didnt see the butcher knife; I just saw the stun gun. And he cut my face open, okay? So, this is great. And the reason I went to sleep was because I had been sick for three days, and I hadnt slept for three days. It was a Friday morning. I found a bottle of gin in one of the cabinets, and it had, you know, a drink worth of gin. And I went, thisll put me to sleep. So, I drank it, and it put me to sleep. It worked like a charm, okay? And so then this whole thing went down. Then the doorbell rang, and I was waiting for my roommate to answer the door. And he didnt answer the door. And I went up to answer the door. I wasnt even awake. And it was [NAME]. And all this [NAME] had to say is, what happened, right? Thats all he had to do. He didnt. He never asked me what happened. He just took one look at me, and decided I was guilty of whatever happened. I:\tWhat did he say, or what did he do to you at that time? R:\tHe said, can you go outside, and wait outside, and can I come into your apartment? He didnt ask me what happened. And I wasnt sure what happened; I was asleep, right? I:\tAnd what did you tell him when he asked you that? R:\tI just went outside. And I thought he was going to come in and talk to my roommate, because thats what the whole thing was about, okay? I was asleep. Do you understand this? It was my roommate and this fucking bitch that got into the whole--I wasnt involved at all, but he didnt know that. He didnt know I had a roommate. He didnt ask me what happened. He just took one look at me, and I was guilty. Its that simple. He didnt ask me how I got my face cut. Nobody ever did--nobody. He just said, go wait outside, and can I come in? And I thought he was going in to talk to my roommate, of course. And so I went outside, and I opened the door, and theres a step outside my door. And I opened the door, and I was stunned. There was an ambulance and three squad cars. And Im like, what the fuck, man? I mean, if it was a squad car, right, you know--or two squad cars. Three squad cars and an ambulance? And I went, what happened? And I sat down on the step, going, what could have happened, and why is there an ambulance, you know? Because I saw my roommate and the psycho bitch. Nobody had touched anybody. And Im the only one that was hurt. I had my face cut open with a knife. I didnt even know it at the time--that it was a knife that he had. And I was sitting there going, wow, what happened, you know? And then two cops came up to me. The paramedics didnt do anything. They didnt come up and say anything about the cut on my face. And two cops came up. And one cop said, what happened? And I said, I dont know. I mean, I thought I knew, but once I saw the ambulance and three squad cars, I was stunned. And I said, Im not sure; I dont know. I said, youre going to have to ask these other people. And he said, we are. And his partner said, I smell alcohol on your breath, because I had just had a glass of gin to go to sleep. And I looked at that piece of shit, and I said, well, is there a law that I dont know about that I cant have a drink in my apartment--or, you know, something to that extent. And he put his tail between his legs and crawled away, you know. And then [NAME] came back down, and he opened the door. And Im sitting there, and he says, do you have any mental health issues? And here I am--I dont know what happened. Im not even awake. I hadnt slept for days. Im completely whacked out. I got my face cut open by this lunatic. And Im sitting there, and I said, well, yeah, because I was going for depression to the clinic. So, I said, well, yeah, I guess, yeah. And he said, thats it. Get up. He didnt ask what the issues were. He didnt say nothing. He just said, get up. And four cops came and grabbed me. And the ambulance came and pulled out a cart, and four officers pinned me down on the cart. And theyre taking me to the ambulance. In other words, if the fucking piece of fucking scum motherfucking shit wouldve asked what happened, he wouldve found out what happened. If my roommate wouldve been there, he wouldve found out what happened. But it was the perfect storm. If he wouldve arrested me, I wouldve gone to jail and been let out. And I wouldve gotten a citation, which I wouldve known about, okay? But I didnt. He decided that I was guilty of whatever happened, and the guilty parties--the bitch and the lunatic upstairs--they didnt want to tell the officer what happened, because they wouldve been arrested. But he didnt know that, because he had shit for fucking brains. He bought into whatever they said; didnt ask me what happened; and decided that I had gone crazy and was responsible for everything that happened. I:\tSo, where did you go after this? R:\tOkay, what happened is, they were wheeling me up into the ambulance, and the fucking psycho bitch that started the whole thing was out in front of her place next door, shoveling some bullshit story to the police. And when they hauled me away, I said, you fucking cunt. I knew it was her fault. I knew she was behind it all, okay? I had reported this woman countless times, and nobody did anything. And when I said the C-word, it turned out that the ambulance paramedic was a fucking stinking dyke cunt crap bag of shit, and she didnt like hearing the C-word. So, as they hauled me to the ambulance, she took out this big, giant hypodermic needle and said, thats it for you. I:\tShe took out what? R:\tA hypo needle, giant. And she said, thats it for you. And she just laid it onto me, okay? And then I woke up. I came to. I didnt know at the time I was at [NAME]. And I came to. I didnt see anybody. Everything was dark. And there was a table next to me, and my house keys were on the table next to me. And I looked down, and I said, my keys. And then I blacked out, okay, completely. The next thing, I woke up. I was in a hallway of the psych ward at [NAME]. I didnt know where I was. I didnt know what time it was, what day it was. I didnt know nothing. And thats when I came to. And then I went through that. And then they ended up giving me cab fare because I didnt have my wallet. I didnt have nothing. I didnt have any shoes. And they gave me cab fare to get home. And thank God I had my keys. And I came home, and I opened the door, and I come into my apartment, and went into my room. And my wallet was open on my dresser, and my drivers license was gone. And guess what? There was a card right there for my appointment with the therapist at the clinic. In other words, Officer Fuckshit saw this card. And when he saw that I was going to a clinic, he decided that I went off, because I was crazy. Its that simple, okay? And thats what happened. And then I went down to try and get my drivers license back and get a story about what happened. And Officer Fuckshit claimed that he didnt take my license. He did. Hes a thief and a liar. And they told me, you have to go to the Hall of Justice to get it if you want a copy of the police report. So, that ended up saving me, because I went down there, and they refused to give me a copy of the police report. They dont have to. They just fuck anybody they want to fuck. Thats what they do. Nobody stops them. Nobody stops them. And they refused to give me a copy of the police report. And this went on, and on, and on. And I called up to complain to the OCC about what happened. As soon as I told the OCC what happened, they knew immediately that this cop had seriously fucked up, okay? And I wouldnt have gone to the OCC because I already knew about them in 2005. I learned the whole nightmare. I knew that they worked for the cops. I knew that they were dirty, rotten people, okay? But my nephew said that there was some place in the Tenderloin that would help you fight the police, okay? And he said, you should make a complaint. And I said, I dont want to complain to the OCC. I said, they work for the cops. Theyre assholes. And he said, well, if you dont file a complaint, theyre not going to, you know, help you out. So, I called the OCC, made a complaint, and they knew immediately that the cop fucked up, okay? I:\tWhy do you say that they knew immediately? R:\tBecause my roommate was never mentioned by anybody, number one. Number two, on the police report--which I was never given--theres no statement from me or my roommate. Gee, how could that happen? Wheres my statement? Wheres my roommates statement? My roommate was not even mentioned. My roommate did not exist, because nobody mentioned him. The perpetrators didnt mention him, because then they wouldve been in jail. The police didnt mention him, because they didnt want to admit that Officer Asshole had fucked up, right? So, thats what they do. They do this every day and every night. They do this for a living. They completely slammed the door on me. I have every piece of paper to prove this. And theyre supposed to give you a copy of your complaint, but they dont--just like youre supposed to get a copy of the police report that youre not given, because theyre all guilty. Theyre guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. And they control everything. And nobody, nobody gets in their face and does anything about it--nobody--because they cant. And just like I have learned in 2005, if you want to go to court, and youre going to court against the police, you lose. Its your word against the police, case closed--thats it. If you think different, youre wrong. In fact, everybody told me that--every lawyer, every law student, everybody I went to in 2005 to get punishment for these criminals that just fucking beat the shit out of me. They all said the same thing. All of them said the same thing. They said, if you go to court, its your word against the police. You lose. I:\tWas this your personal experience, as well? R:\tWell, I didnt go to court. Why would I go to court? Its my word against the cops; I lose. And I couldnt afford a lawyer. And in case you dont know it, public defenders areanybody involved with the police department is a piece of shit. They know it. They do this every day. They know what theyre doing--just like the OCC. In 2005, when I was finally taken out of my cell, everybody knew I was injured. Nobody did anything. And when I was finally taken--it was a black gal officer that took me out of my cell, and she said, are you injured? And I said, of course Im injured. Everybody knows that. And I showed her my injuries. And she said, oh my God, you have to come and see the nurse. And I said, are you kidding me? Everybody saw my injuries. They all turned their heads and looked the other way. I didnt know there was a nurse. Nobody told me. And she said, if you want to file a complaint--because I told her what happened--and she said, if you want to file a complaint, you call the District Attorneys Office and file a complaint. And thats what other officers told me. But when you call the District Attorneys Office to file a complaint, they dont deal with complaints. Thats when I learned about the OCC--Office of Citizen Complaints. And then finding out what they did to me was just unbelievable. They work for the police. Their job is to just get rid of you. And not only that, theyll take your information that you gave, and use it against you, because their job is to protect the police, okay? Thats their job. And then I was stupid enough to get out a phone book. And I looked in the phone book, and theres attorneys. I had never looked for an attorney before. And there was a thousand pages of attorneys in the phone book. The rest of the phone book was nothing. It was all attorneys, attorneys, attorneys, attorneys, attorneys, attorneys, attorneys--unbelievable. And you know what? Not one of them dealt with the police. I:\tOkay, [NAME], so were going to come back to these questions regarding the exact arrest experiences at a later point in the interview, but right now, we just need to finish up with these questions about mental and emotional health. You mentioned believing that you might have depression at some point in your life or a self-diagnosis. R:\tYeah, of course. I:\tDo you think that is still an issue for you? R:\tWell, yeah, it is. Of course it is. I:\tWell, what about any other emotional or mental health conditions that you might believe you have now? R:\tNo, thats it. Im depressed. I live in hell. For craps sakes, man, I tell it the way it is. To me, its hell. I:\tAnd youve been in San Francisco your entire life--the majority of it, at least. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd you claim that you had depression at a certain point when you were younger, and that you still have it now. What about in the past before that? Do you feel like youve always had depression, or is there a certain point that it occurred? R:\tWell, not really. I mean, we were a very poor family. But it didnt bother me, you know. And then when I turned 18, they wanted to ship me off to Vietnam. And it was kind of a challenging time. And I thought, well, Jesus, if these guys were attacking us, I would step right up to the plate, you know, and do battle, okay? But Im not going to go over and fight these guys I dont even know that arent even attacking us. Im not going to do it. So, I had to deal with that. And I remember, it was the only time I ever voted in my life. And it was very interesting. And everything on the ballot was all bullshit. It still is. Its all bullshit, and lies, and bullshit, and lies, bullshit, and lies, bullshit, and lies. And they had the marijuana initiative. This is when I was 18 years old--to legal marijuana. But the government had told Americans--who are brain-dead, brainwashed sheep, of course--that if you smoke marijuana today, youre going to be shooting heroin tomorrow. And they bought it, just like they buy into cigarette smoke is killing everybody. Its all a lie. Its all bullshit. Its all bullshit. Its all lies. And so anyway, that was my first and only voting experience. And needless to say, they didnt legalize marijuana; they arrested innocent people that have done nothing, and screwed up the whole system, and put innocent people in jail that have done nothing. And I:\tRegarding that last set of questions that we just went through about the mental and emotional health conditions, is there anything else that you want to add before we go to the next section? R:\tNot really. Its just disappointing to me is the main word. Im disappointed that everybody went down the wrong road. And then theyre all oblivious to the real world. Its just disappointing. Its very disappointing. Lifes simple. All you need is a roof over your head, and some stuff to eat and drink, and youre good to go. All this greedy ass bullshit, and the big house, and the fancy cars, and all the bull--its just unnecessary. Its just stupid. Its stupid, unnecessary shit. And Im just disappointed. You know, what would be good for me would be to move up to Humboldt County and get a part-time job. At least I would be working, you know. And I would be in Gods country, where you can go out hiking and stuff. You go out--all the places that I used to go to here, theyre all full of homeless people. They found every little pocket of the city that I used to hang out--because I knew the secret places. I was born and raised here, okay? And its just homeless. Its a tourist trap--24/7 tourist trap. Its China. Other people dont understand that about this place. Its China. We live in China. I didnt move to China; China moved here, okay? And in case you didnt know it, the Chinese own tens of thousands of businesses in San Francisco. Theyre not going to hire you. Theyre not going to hire me. Do you speak Chinese? I:\tNo, I dont. R:\tYou dont get the job. Well, they own all the businesses. Whats wrong with this picture? See, its another question that nobody asks or talks about, but its a fact. I:\tSo, regarding your specific arrest, what are the actual offenses that you were arrested for officially? R:\tOh, the first one--they said I was drunk in public, and I resisted arrest. Thats what they said. And I wasnt drunk, and I didnt resist nothing. They just pinned me on the ground without any warning at all. This guy had this act down, okay? And they just decided to pull it on me, because whos going to stop them? Nobody. So, they gave me the business. And that was their excuse. And when I was booked down at the Hall of Injustice, the filthy, stinking cops down there, they didnt--when I showed them my injuries, I didnt even know how messed up I was, okay? This all happened like boom. I showed them my injuries, and you know what they did? They turned their heads and looked in the other direction. In other words, they see this every goddamn fucking day and every goddamn fucking night. And thats how they deal with it. They didnt have to ask me how I was injured; they knew that I had gotten beaten up by these fucking lunatic drug-crazed criminals. So, thats how they deal with it; they turn their head and look the other way. Its their code, okay? And I was never given a phone call. I was never read any rights. Not one word was said to me. I was treated worse than a dog going to the veterinarian, okay? I:\tOkay, Ill have some followup questions for you about that in a bit. But for now, what about the second arrest and the third arrest? What were the official offenses that you were arrested for? R:\tWell, the first one was when I was driving a cab, right? Okay. And he tried to do it again, and it didnt go over because everybody knew that the guy was whacked out, right? They knew. Why is he still out there? I:\tSo, you were not arrested at that time? R:\tThe second time, no. I:\tThe one that they brought you into the station? R:\tYeah. They just said, go back in your cab, and go to work, and forget that this ever happened. I:\tSo, youve really only been arrested two times, then. R:\tThree times. I:\tThe second time [01:44:51 crosstalk]? R:\tNo, the first time, they did arrest me and nine other cab drivers. But my father bailed me out. And the case was just dropped immediately. I:\tAnd what was the offense for that arrest? R:\tI dont know what he said. He said I made an illegal left turn or something, which I didnt do. He was a nutcase. He was a loon. Not only that, the whole department knew that he was a loon. I:\tSo, one, illegal left turn; two, drunk in public and resisting arrest. And three--whats the third one? R:\tOh, they charged me for elderly abuse, because the guy who cut my face open with a knife--he told the police that I tried to kick down his door and break into his apartment, because I wanted a bud of marijuana. Unbelievable. And Ive lived there 40 fucking years. Im not going to break into his place. Goddamn, its broad daylight anyway. I mean, the whole thing was just ridiculous. But the thing is, the police bought it because they had to. I:\tSo, there was no charge for burglary, as well? R:\tNo, they charged me for elderly abuse. And they gave me a public defender who was a total cunt bitch. And she had a supervisor that was a total cunt bitch, okay? Heres your American justice up your American wazoo. This countrys a cesspool tank and the American justice system--everybody knows it, but they wont talk about it, because theyre Americans, okay? Theyre not going to talk about it. They just sweep it under the rug with all the rest of the filthy, dirty shit. In other words, in 2005, when I was locked up in jail, if I was a senators son, I wouldve made a phone call. I wouldve been bailed out. I wouldve been taken to a hospital. I wouldve had lawyers coming around asking questions, okay? But Im not a senators son. I couldnt get bailed out. Youre fucked, and you dont have a lawyer, and you dont have a doctor. Thats America. You got the money, you got a chance. You dont have any money, fuck you. You fucking rot. And when youre in jail, its just like a free country. This is the least free country on the planet. The United States--theyre not united. Anybody who thinks they are is brain-dead. Innocent until proven guilty--what a real load of garbage that is. Youre guilty until proven innocent. And when youre in jail, they dont treat you like youre innocent. I:\tLets talk about the way they treat you. How do they treat you? What are some specific examples? R:\tWell, I showed them my injuries, and they turned their heads and looked the other--they didnt say, oh, youre injured; how did you receive your injuries? Thats what anybody would do. Thats the first thing that any medical person, or paramedic, or anybody would say. Youre injured; how did you receive your injuries? Thats the first thing that they say. They didnt say that; they turned their heads and looked the other way. And that was my tipoff that thats what they do. They know how I received my injuries. They didnt ask. They didnt have to ask. And thats how they deal with it, okay? And they just put me in a cell with a few other guys. It was sort of funny. And then the guys in the cell were the good guys. All the people that worked out there with that--they were the sickest shit on the planet. And the guys in jail told me--they saw my injuries, and they said, man, you got to ask for a nurse. And I said, gee, they have a nurse here? And they said, yeah. And so the next time the guard came by, I said, gee, can I see the nurse? And he laughed at me. And I showed him my injuries, and he laughed at me. He thought it was funny. I:\tWhat exactly made you believe that the guys in the cells were good guys, aside from the idea that they told you to go see a nurse? R:\tTheyre the only guys who told me that there was a nurse. I wouldnt have known. And they told me my rights. The cops didnt tell me nothing. They told me what my rights were. I wouldnt have known. They didnt tell me nothing. I was treated like a piece of shit, okay? Its that simple. And then the night shift--all the pieces of shit that worked at night went home, and the day shift came, and they opened the cell door. After four hours, theyre supposed to let you out, and you go for a hearing. And I didnt know that, but the bad guys told me that--the guys in jail. The good guys are really the bad guys. They didnt tell me that. So, after four hours, they got out, okay? And when my four hours came up, they didnt let me out. And the guard came by. And I said, gee, Ive been here for four hours; are you going to let me out of here or what? And he says, we can keep you here as long as we want. Oh, okay, asshole. Fuck. Stinking badge-wearing piece of scum fuck--keep me here as long as you want, you piece of shit. And I sat down on the floor, and my injuries were really starting to kick in. It was really bad. And then somebody came and opened the cell door and said, milk or juice? I said, juice. And he threw a thing of orange juice at me. And I drank the juice. I was really thirsty. Then I sat there on the floor. I was really hurting at the time. And then thats when the black gal came in and said, are you injured? And I said, fuck, I told everybody Im injured; nobody did nothing. And she took me to the nurse. And the first thing that the nurse should say, believe me, is, how did you receive your injuries? Its the first thing that you say. She didnt say that. She didnt have to; she knew. And she cleaned all the blood off of my leg. And she didnt put stitches in me. And she cleaned my arm, and gave me ice to put on my arm. And then they put me through the whole fingerprint and photograph--because youre guilty, right? Youre arrested. You wouldnt be there--thats it. These guys that they pin badges on--Ill tell you a secret. Its a total fact. They are, in fact, judge, jury, and executioner. And thats it; case closed. Anybody who doesnt agree with that is stupid, or ignorant, or a liar. They are judge, jury, and executioner. Whatever they say you did, you did it. They couldve shot me, and said that I didnt comply. They would have walked. They would have walked. In fact, the police shot and killed my oldest, best friend, right up here on Greenwich Street and Polk--shot him and killed him. I:\tWow. Did that change the way that you felt about [01:53:24 crosstalk]? R:\tOh, no, no, no, not at all. I already knew what they were. I:\tHow many times have you been convicted, approximately? R:\tNever. Well, I dont know. The last one, I took a plea deal. The cop that didnt even ask me what happened, and decided that I had gone crazy--I took a plea deal, because my public defender--cunt bitch--and her supervisor lied to my face about the plea deal. And I told the supervisor--I said, this woman stinks. Shes not a lawyer. She doesnt belong. Shes throwing me in the garbage--because public defenders pick and choose who theyre going to spend time with, and who theyre just going to flush down the toilet, okay? Thats what they do. And she decided to flush me down the toilet. So, once I realized that, I talked to her supervisor. And I said, I want a lawyer. I said, a beginner lawyer could take this case and go to town. And she wouldnt give me a lawyer. And then the last thing she told me was that I could fill out a so-and-so form in the court on my court date to ask for a real lawyer. And thats what I was going to do. The judge was hella cool. He was a really cool judge. I dealt with this guy a few times. He was really nice. But he didnt know what had happened to me, and I didnt know. And then on the day I was going to ask for the form to get a real lawyer, my lawyer, my public defender, came out and gave me this load of shit, saying, well, you have to pay for the window, and go to anger management or something. And her supervisor took me out in the hallway and told me, you just have to do this and do this. Then the judge--I agreed with the thing, okay, and when I agreed that I would pay for the window and go to anger management class--whatever that was about--everything was a lie. Everything they told me was a lie. Theyre pieces of shit. Were talking about all the good guys--all the people that are running the show. Theyre pieces of fucking shit. And so then when I made the plea deal and agreed, everybody handed me a piece of paper, okay? And I had four pieces of paper. And I put them in my backpack. And I got home, and I took out the pieces of paper and realized that my lawyer had lied to me and her supervisor about the whole thing. I didnt know. I wouldve told the judge immediately in court, but I didnt know until I got home, and read this paperwork, and went, they lied to me about the whole thing. I:\tSo, the next set of questions is in reference to your experience with incarceration, probation, or parole. So, juvenile detention, you said you didnt have because the first time you were arrested ... R:\tWell, I wasnt on probation or parole. I:\tBut you were incarcerated in jail, correct? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd how old were you when you first went to jail? R:\tThe first time, when I was driving cab, they put us in a paddy wagon, and took us down to the Hall of Justice, and strip-searched us, and then gave us a phone call. And my father bailed me out. I:\tHow old were you then? R:\tI was in my late 20s; maybe 27, something like that, yeah. I:\tAnd how many times have you been in jail? You said ... R:\tOkay, and then nothing happened until the 2005 thing. I:\tSo, just two, correct? R:\tAnd I was in jail for the night. And they let me out the next morning. So, I just spent the night in jail. I never went to court. I mean, I wanted to go to court. And everybody told me, you dont want to go to court. And I said, I want to go to court. These guys just beat the shit out of me for no reason without any warning of any kind. I want to go to court. And they all told me, it aint going to happen, because its your word against theirs. You lose; case closed. So ... I:\tSo, those two incidents--how many ... R:\tAnd then the last one was the one where, again, they didnt put me in jail; they hauled me off to the psych ward. And I never had a court date. I mean, I went to court, but like I said, my public defender and her supervisor lied to my face about the plea deal. So, I took the plea deal. So, I dont know what that means, but I did take the plea deal, because they lied to me about the plea deal. And the judge didnt know that they lied to me. I didnt know that they lied to me until I got home, and the whole thing was done. So, the first time, I spent a few hours in jail. The second time, I spent maybe eight hours or something before they let me go. And the last time, I never went to jail. I:\tSo, about 10 hours total, youre saying? R:\tFor all three things. And if my father wouldve been alive, I wouldve been bailed out immediately. But my father had passed away, see. But the first time, he came and bailed me out before you could say, bail me out, okay? But he had passed away. My mother was sick in the hospital. And everybody else I knew didnt have any money to bail me out. So, I couldnt do anything. One of my sisters wouldve bailed me out, but she was out of town on business. I think she was in Japan or something. So, she couldnt come and bail me out. I:\tSo, the next set of questions are about how you might feel about legal authorities, okay? And once again, its from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The first one is, I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. R:\tOh, no, absolutely not. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tAs strongly as you can get. I:\tPeople should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tYou have to. You have no choice. I:\tSo, you would say somewhat agree, strongly agree? R:\tI would say you have to; you have no choice. I:\tStrongly agree or somewhat agree? R:\tYou put down what you want; Im just telling you, you have no choice. I never went to court. I shouldve gone to court. I shouldve had a lawyer. These cops shouldve been prosecuted for what they did. It doesnt work that way. You have no choice. Youre fucked, and youre fucked, okay? Thats it. I:\tIt is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tAbsolutely. If they arrested everybody in this country that was guilty of something, everybody in the country would be in jail. I:\tSo, strongly agree, you would say? R:\tIts all bullshit. The law stinks, and nobodys going to change it. The police state--theyre monsters, but they get away with it, okay? And everybody associated--we live in a cesspool tank, okay? I dont make this up. I dont want to say this. I dont want to know this. But its a fact, okay? I dont want to say that I hate the police and everybody involved with them, but I have to, because if you dont get rid of your rotten apples, youre all rotten, okay? And they dont get rid of their rotten apples, so theyre all rotten. Its a tragedy. Its horrible for everybody. If you cant trust them, who the hell can you trust? I:\tWhat about, the law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me? R:\tWell, I think I agree with the second part of that. I:\tSo, somewhat agree? Why just the second part? R:\tBecause the laws stink, and nobodys doing anything about it to change it, okay? Thats why. I:\tSo, you think that the laws represent people like you but not people who are in power, youre saying? R:\tRight; exactly. And the people in power are going to get away with it, for the most part, 90-something percent of the time, because theyve got the money, the lawyers, they know all the tricks, theyre connected, and theyre going to get away with it, okay? I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tStrongly. I:\tThe law does not protect my interest. R:\tNo, I just told you what they did to me. They took an innocent person, and beat the fucking shit out of me, man--and tortured me, and destroyed my life. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tThats a tough one. I would say most of them probably do, to be honest. I:\tSomewhat agree or strongly agree? R:\tSomewhat agree. I think most of them have the right intentions, okay? But on the other hand, if they protect bad cops who are the lowest of the low, the worst of the--thats not good. See, its their code. They have a code. The code stinks. I understand the code, okay? But the code stinks. If you dont get rid of these fucking scumbags that are out of--these guys are whacked out, man. These are the sickest pieces of fucking shit that there are. If you let them get away with their crimes and dont get rid of them--and Ive met people--most of all my friends were firemen, okay? I went to high school with an asshole, and he turned into a cop. And he got busted in the fajita thing. Oh, that was a funny one. And the other two guys I knew that went into the department were good guys. And once they got into it, and they saw what it was, they got out. They said, we dont work for the devil, and we dont work with the devil. Were getting out. They were trained. They got their badges, and they flushed their badges down the toilet and said, we dont work for the devil. They knew, and they refused to work for the devil, okay? Firemen--they sit around the firehouse all day and night, and do jack shit. I know guys who spent their whole career and never fought one fire. And theyre retired, okay? Cops, on the other hand--firemen either help people or do nothing. The cops are a whole--these guys are the sickest pieces of--theyre really sick people. And its something that everybody in the country is complaining now, okay? Theyre all saying of color, of color, of color. Oh, so if they shoot a black guy, its not good; if they shoot a white guy, its okay. Hes just a white guy. All of that shit is garbage. Those are a bunch of racists. They only care about black people. I care about everybody. I dont care what color you are, okay? Youre either a good person, or youre not; its that simple. Its all real simple stuff thats been turned into a bunch of--you know. And the cops--as far as abusing black people or Mexicans--no, they abuse white people just as much, except white people just dont give a shit. Theyre not going to go marching down the street, you know, and doing whatever black people do to complain. They need to be trained properly. They dont have to shoot and kill people. They just dont have to, okay? Like [NAME]--okay, they didnt have to fucking shoot him and kill him. They killed him right in front of hundreds of people. Everybody had cell phones and taking pictures. They just gunned him down, man, and I said, oh, I thought my taser was my--you didnt even need to taser the poor guy. He was already pinned down. They just murdered him in cold blood, man. And that fucking piece of shit was bitching because he couldnt get his job back again, so he could gun down other innocent people by mistake and get away with it, okay? I mean, thats just proof. Thats just undeniable proof. They just murdered the poor guy in cold blood. I:\tWhat about the question ... R:\tI dont like that. I:\tMost police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tNo, not now. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tI disagree. They used to. They dont anymore. I:\tSomewhat disagree, you would say? R:\tI disagree. Thats the way it is nowadays. Everythings changed. People used to respect people, and now they dont. And in a way, you cant blame them, because everybodys so screwed up. I:\tWhat about, the basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police? R:\tYes, I think so. I:\tSomewhat agree or strongly agree? R:\tI think that they have really good intentions. I:\tSo, you would say somewhat agree? R:\tI would have to say somewhat, because even though they have good intentions, you get these fucking assholes like I ran into, okay? But what Im saying is, I think most of them have good intentions, and I respect that they have a really bad job. Its really, really a bad job, being a cop in this city, okay? Its not easy. But I respect most of them. But its hard for me to confirm that, because, like I said, they dont get rid of their rotten apples, and you have to do that, because a bad cop is the worst thing that there is outside, see. Its one of them deals. I:\tWhat about, the police in my city have too much power? R:\tOh, yeah, theyre judge, jury, and executioner. I:\tStrongly agree, you would say? R:\tTheyre judge, jury--thats a fact. I:\tMost police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tStrongly. I:\tAnd why do you say that? R:\tBecause thats the way it is. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened, abused, and otherwise treated inappropriately by the police? Yes, you have, according to what youve said. R:\tOf course I have, as bad as it could be. They destroyed my fucking life and got away with it. I:\tAbout how many times has this happened, would you say, in your lifetime? R:\tWell, the first guy--I was just in jail for a couple of hours, okay, and my father bailed me out. The second time, they beat the shit out of me, man. They pinned me down on the cement, and just beat the fucking--I did nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. These guys were whacked out on drugs, okay? And Ill tell you, its steroids, for one thing. They dont have any balls, or guts, or brains. They have enough brains to know that theyre going to get away with it. They dont have any balls. They take steroids. And when you combine steroids with alcohol or other drugs, youre creating a monster, and thats what they are. These guys were whacked out on drugs, the guys who beat me up. Theres no ifs, ands, or buts about it, no question. In fact, my roommate and three of my friends--the first thing that came out of their mouths, the first thing was the first thing that came out of my mind. All of them said, these guys were whacked out on drugs. And the next guy I talked to said, well, if you ask me, these guys were whacked out on drugs. All of them said the same thing. These guys live in the real world. My family, who lives in cyberspace--they live in fantasyland--they didnt say that, because they dont know about the real world. They just assumed I must have done something; cops wouldnt beat up an innocent person--because theyre brain-dead. Theyre Americans. Theyre brainwashed. Theyre brain-dead. Theyre out of touch. Theyre out of tune. They live in denial, and they wont admit it. They dont know whats going on in the real world. My friends all immediately--the first thing they said--these guys were whacked out on drugs--because they were. I:\tHow many times would you say that youve been stopped or treated unfairly by the police? R:\tWell, those three times and a couple more times when I was driving cab. I got a ticket for something I shouldnt have been tagged for. But those three times were the three times that I was arrested. I:\tYou would say one to five times total? And the last time this happened was 2012? R:\t[NAME]. And you dont know the whole story. I didnt complete the story. I:\tWhats the rest of the story? R:\tOh, the rest of the story is, when I got home from the hospital, I had my keys. Remember, I told you I saw my keys on the table when I came to from being unconscious? And so I came into my apartment, and my wallet was open, and my drivers license was gone. Where did it go? I:\tThe card was in its place, you said, right? R:\tAnd the card for the clinic was right there. Thats how this brain-dead idiot made his assumption. He assumed. Thats why he didnt even ask me. I:\tHow do you know that it was him who took it? R:\tHes the only one who was in my apartment, for Gods sakes, man. And I never got a copy of the police report, okay? And I kept calling, and calling, and calling. And finally, some guy told me to call the District Attorneys Office. I called the District Attorneys Office. I gave them the case number, and they said, well, its being investigated. Then I called them two months later because I still hadnt gotten a copy of the police report. I wanted to know what shit that they shoveled in this police report. And they said, somebodys being charged. I said, charged with what? And they said, well, we dont know. And I still continually didnt get a copy of the police report. And I was at the end of my rope. And I called up the District Attorneys Office again. And it was the end of the line. I almost didnt, but I did. And when I called them up, they said, whats your name? And I told them my name. And they said, well, you have a warrant. I said, what are you talking about? What? And he said, you missed a court date. I said, a court date? I didnt have a court date. What are you talking about? Well, sir, thats all we can say, is you had a court date, and you didnt show up. And theres a warrant out for you. And you should go down to the Hall of Justice, and take care of it. So, I went to the Hall of Justice. Thats when I was giving the public defender, this fucking, stinking, fucking bitch. And she took me out in the hallway, and she opened up this file. And she showed me a copy of a citation. And she said, did you ever see this? And I said, no, I never got this citation. And it turns out Officer Fucking Asshole wrote me a citation while I was unconscious in the hospital, with all my drivers license information on it because he stole my drivers license, the piece of shit, the sick-ass fuck. And he wrote me a citation. And where its signed--youre supposed to sign your citation. That means you know that you got it. I didnt sign it. I was unconscious. He signed it. And he never gave it to me. Hows that? I wouldve been wandering around with a citation, not even knowing that theres a warrant on me, because I was never informed. And I called the District Attorneys Office, and I say, shouldnt you notify people when theres a warrant on them? And they said, well, sir, we dont have time to tell everybody that theres a warrant on them. I:\tWhat about race? How would you say race has shaped your experience with the police? R:\tNothing, nothing. Had nothing to do with anything. I know everybody makes a big deal out of that, but I called [NAME]. You heard of [NAME], the big hot-shot attorney? I:\tI havent heard of him. R:\tYouve never heard of him? Hes on the news all the time. Anyway, I called his office. I called everybody I could call when this happened. I wanted a lawyer. And thats when I found out that lawyers dont deal with the police. You can look through the phone book. Go ahead; I did. I spent a week going through the phone book, trying to find an attorney that would deal with the police--nope. They dont deal with the police. I:\tSo, the next set of questions are about the arrest that led to your most recent pretrial detention experience--and thus, the time you spent in jail waiting for a decision on your case. R:\tI wasnt arrested. I shouldve been. If they wouldve arrested me, everything wouldve worked out. They pinned me on a gurney, and drugged me, and put me in a fucking--and these doctors--all they know is that this cop told them that I had gone crazy when Im not the one that went crazy; I was sleeping, see, but they dont know that. All they know is what the officer told them. And thats what they had to deal with, okay? I:\tSo, you explained the circumstances that led to this already, and you claim that you were not arrested or you dont consider yourself arrested at that time, but you say you ... R:\tNo, I wasnt arrested. I:\tYou were held in detention for eight hours, then, you said? R:\tI was taken to [NAME]. Why they took me there, I have no idea. That was stupid. Then I ended up in the psych ward at [NAME], okay? Thats when I came to, okay? And then I had to wait for them to have time to screen me, and then they just let me go, okay? I didnt belong there, and ... I:\tSo, how long total? R:\tIm not sure. I was unconscious when I got there, okay? Its hard to know when youre unconscious, hello? I would guess maybe 10 hours, maybe at the psych ward. And how long was I at [NAME]X--I have no idea; I was unconscious. And you should see the doctor report. Oh, man. When I got back, it was unbelievable. I have every piece of paper to prove how all of this shit went down, man--every piece of paper, everything--my complaints to the OCC, everything the police gave me, everything that happened, everything, everything. I:\tSo, what was it like when you were there for the 10 hours? R:\tIt was fucked up. It was just fucked up. I mean, first, this guy tried to--when he saw me wake up, he tried to give me all these pills. And I said, I dont want this shit; get away from me. And then I finally asked the nurse. She was nice. She told me where I was. She told me what time it was. I sure didnt know. And shes the one that gave me a cab voucher to get home, because I didnt have any shoes or any money. I was just kidnapped, and assaulted, and tortured. Right, yeah--by the good guys. Right. All he had to do was ask me what happened. Thats all he had to do. Thats all he had to do. Do you understand this? If he just wouldve said, what happened? Everything wouldve been different. He just assumed. I:\tSo, the 10 hours that you were staying there--what about any obligations that you had on the outside that you couldnt fulfill or responsibilities? Were there any? R:\tNo. I:\tWere there any arrangements that you made so that any obligations on the outside could be met? R:\tI just waited until they let me out. I:\tAnd what kind of programs or services were available to you while you were there for 10 hours? R:\tNothing, nothing. I:\tWhat about any services that werent offered but that you wouldve used had they been available? R:\tNo, this all happened just like that. It just happened. I mean, I had no idea. I never even had a chance to wake up when I was being hauled away, and tortured, and kidnapped by these psycho lunatics. I never had a chance. They didnt even ask me what happened. Never even asked. I got the copy of the police report. If you want to see it, Ive got it at home. You look at it. You look at it. You give it to a lawyer, and have them look at it, and theyre going to go, what the fuck is this? They wont believe it. I:\tDid your family know about this incident when you were ... R:\tNo. They knew as soon as I got home. I:\tAnd how did they find out about it? R:\tI called up and told them. I:\tHow did they respond? How did they react? R:\tWell, I told you all my friends know that I got fucked. But my family--theyre brain-dead. Theyre Americans. Theyre Americans. I:\tWhat did they say, or what did they do? R:\tThey didnt do anything; they just assumed that I had done something, because cops wouldnt just go and take away an innocent person, okay? They have shit for brains. Theyre Americans. Cops wouldnt just do that to an innocent person. Yeah, they would, and they did. You just dont get it, because youre brainwashed and brain-dead, okay? Theyre Americans. Theyre sheep. They believe it all. I:\tHow did that make you feel about yourself, that they didnt believe it all, or ... R:\tI hated them. I didnt ever want to talk to my family again, except for the two sisters--the two sisters that I told you around early--they knew. They knew. They knew that I didnt do nothing. But the rest of the family were just--you know, didnt give a shit at all. I:\tWhile you were away for 10 hours, were you allowed any visits, or phone calls, or mail, or anything? R:\tOh, no, nothing. I:\tAnd the times that you were in jail in the past--were there any people that you thought would stay in touch with you, or you would keep in touch with that you didnt? R:\tNo, but they were the only guys--well, the last time, I didnt go to jail, right? I went to the hospital. The time when I was beaten up, I was with three other guys in a cell. And they were all good people. That was the whole deal. Its like, whats wrong here? The good guys are in jail, and everybody out here is a piece of shit. How ironic is that? You cant get anymore ironic, okay? The good guys are in jail, and the scum of the earth are wearing badges and treating people like shit. And they treat you worse than a dog. Youre in jail, see. Yeah, innocent until proven guilty--put that down. Bullshit, lies, bullshit, lies, bullshit, lies. Its all a lie. Its all a lie. Its all a lie. But America was born on lies and bullshit. White man speak with forked tongue. They took over this country, raped the Indians, flushed them down the toilet, and destroyed the whole country. I:\tSo, did this incident--when you were away in the hospital for 10 hours--you know, sent away, taken away--did this cause you to experience any financial debt or any ... R:\tNo, no, no, no, nothing. No, no, nothing. Uh-uh, no. I:\tYou didnt have to pay anything? R:\tNo. I:\tWhat about when you were getting out? Can you tell me about that? R:\tWell, I didnt have a wallet. I didnt have any money. I didnt have any shoes, because I was kidnapped, okay, while I was tortured and abused. And I told the nurse my situation. And she said, well, maybe I can find you some shoes. And she came back and said, I cant. And I had my house keys. Thats all I had. And then I told her, I said, look, lady, I drove cab for 15 fucking years. I took 100 people from this hospital home with a voucher. So, she went and gave me a voucher for the taxi. And I called a cab, and the cab took me home. And she was very nice. And the doctor didnt really even talk to me. He talked to her, and did some stuff on the computer. But he didnt really even talk to me; just the nurse. And she was very nice. I:\tDid you hear anything from the courts or any legal authorities after this ... R:\tNothing, nothing, nothing. If I wouldnt have called up--the fact is, the fact that they didnt give me a copy of the police report--thats what saved me. I wouldnt have called the District Attorneys Office 10 times, okay? Theyre the ones that told me it was being investigated. Then they told me that there was charges filed months later. Then months later, they told me that there was a warrant on me, okay? I wouldnt have had no idea. How would I know? How would you know? You never got a citation. How did you know? How did you know? You missed a court date. What? I never had a court date. Oh, yeah, you did. You missed it. I didnt have a court date. Ive got a copy of the citation at home if you want to see it. You wont see my signature on it because I didnt sign it. I was unconscious. The filthy, fucking, badge-wearing, bag of shit [NAME] signed it. I didnt sign it. I had no idea. And if I wouldnt have made that last phone call to the DAs Office--are you getting this--I wouldve had no idea that there was a warrant on me. How could I? How could I? I never got a citation. I wouldve loved to have gone to court. I wouldve loved it. I never had a court date. I:\tWhat did you do after you got out of the hospital, exactly, aside from call your family and let them ... R:\tNo, I came home, and I wanted to talk to my roommate. But my roommate heard that I had gotten hauled away by the police. And he knew that I was innocent. I didnt do nothing. I was asleep. So, he disappeared. I didnt see him for two weeks. And then when he came back, I asked him what happened. And he said, I dont want to talk about; Im moving out at the end of the month. And he moved out, okay? And then the funny thing is, I got a letter from the landlord charging me for the broken window. Remember, I told you? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. R:\tAnd hes the one that told me everything that happened. He said that the woman next door had problems with her computer, and she had a temper tantrum--that she was known to. And she is a monster--and that my roommate got into a screaming match with her, and that the guy upstairs started yelling at me. And I went up there to deal with him, and broke his window, and he cut my face open with a knife. I didnt know how my face got cut open. I didnt even know. I have that document. And my lawyer said, oh, that doesnt mean anything. I said, that tells the whole story, you brain-dead--there it is. She was a piece of shit. I think she was a cokehead. I would bet on it. Saying that she stunk--she was a thousand miles beyond stink, and her supervisor was a bitch. These people--they just dont care. They just flush you down the toilet, you know. Theres your American justice. The whole things a nightmare. And its really disturbing stuff. And just like this whole thing with the police being judge, jury, and executioner--its a fact. Its a stone-cold fact. Theres no ifs, ands, or buts. Thats the way it is. If they say you did it, you did it [02:32:33 unintelligible]. I would say maybe 95, 98% of the time, thats it, unless youre a senators son, and youre hooked up to a rich-ass lawyer. Then you might be able to deal with it somehow, and theyll cut the crap. Otherwise, these guys are, in fact--Im not making this up--they are judge, jury, and executioner. Thats that. They tortured me. They shot and killed my best friend. They tortured, and kidnapped me, and robbed me, and fucked me. I:\tSo, what were some of the negative consequences that you experienced after the visit to the hospital? R:\tEverything, everything, everything. Just totally brutalized me. Thats when I started going to the clinic down there. And I told them about what happened. And my roommate at the time was trying to tell me, you have to let it go, man. You know, you cant dwell on it. And I said, I dont have a life. I said, if I had a life, then I would let it go, because I would have a life. But I dont have a life, and I cant help dwelling on it. It happened to me, man. And its one of these deals. If I didnt know the way it really is--I mean, I always knew there was bad people and bad cops, but after what happened to me, it took its toll. It just took its toll on me completely in every way, shape, and form. And physically, they mashed in the whole side of me. So, it took me over a year at least to recover from this brutal assault with a billy club while I was laying on the ground, getting the shit beat out of me without any warning of any kind for doing absolutely nothing. These guys were on drugs. They had this act down. They decided to pull it on me, and they did. They pulled it on me, and they did, and they got away with it, okay? And then what I said is, that opened up Pandoras Box, because I learned all about the OCC, and the department, and the whole deal. It opened up Pandoras Box. And it was something that you dont want to know. Its just horrible, horrible, horrible to know that. I wish I didnt know that, but I do. And Ill tell you what its like--its like carrying a big, heavy cross around with you wherever you go. Thats what its like. I:\tSo, how was the experience when you were in the hospital for 10 hours different than you might have expected such an experience to be? R:\tNo, I was just there. I was just there, waiting to get out. All I did was, I wanted to know where I was, because, of course, I didnt know. I was unconscious. And I wanted to know what day it was and what time it was. And they offered me some food finally, about five hours in. And the food was disgusting. And I was really hungry, but I didnt eat it. And Ive been in [NAME] when I was attacked by the other cops, and the food there was really good. But this food was dog food. I didnt even eat it. Dogs wouldnt eat it. And I just waited for them to release me. And she ended up giving me a voucher to get home, which was--she was very nice. And I never talked to the doctor at all. And that was it. And then when I got home, my roommate wasnt there--because I wanted to know what the fuck happened, for craps sakes, man. He wasnt there. And thats when I saw my wallet open, and my drivers license was gone, because the cop ripped me off. And I saw the card for the clinic, and it all came together. In other words, he came back to my ... I:\tDid anything good come from this? R:\tNo. I:\tNothing? R:\tWell, the first time in 2005, when I was assaulted and beat the shit out of, to be honest, I wanted to kill him. Once I realized what had happened, and that they got away with this crime--this was as despicable--you cant get any lower than beating up an innocent person thats done nothing because youre on drugs, and whacked out, and just dont like him. And youve done it before, and youre going to get away with it. I wanted to get a hand grenade, and throw it in their squad car, and blow them to hell, okay? And obviously, I wouldve been on Death Row before you could say Death Row. And these filthiest, most despicable scum wouldve been paraded like big heroes down the street. And thats when I went, wait a minute. I dont mind going on Death Row for taking care of business, because nobody else is going to do it, because nobodys going to do it. Do you understand that? Nobodys going to do it. Nobodys going to do it. And I dont mind going to jail, but seeing these pieces of shit paraded down the street like big heroes when theyre the most despicable, filthiest, dirtiest, sickest scum that there is outsidethats unacceptable. Thats not going to happen. See, the thing about the cops is, when you go and get arrested, they punch you in your whatever, and theres your whole history. Boom, right on that computer screen, okay, everything. If you want to see a cops--no, they hide all of it. Its all hidden and controlled. Theyre not going to show you what happened with this cop, what his record is, how many times hes been accused. No, it doesnt happen. They dont have the guts to tell you the way it happens. Its all controlled, completely and totally controlled. I:\tSo, just to be clear, the only time that you had a pretrial diversion experience was related to the incident in 2012, correct? R:\tYeah. I didnt know I had a warrant. How would I? I:\tCan you tell me about the day that you left that hospital that you were in for 10 hours? R:\tYeah, I came home in a taxi cab, and I came into my apartment, and went into my room. And my wallet was open, and my license was gone, and I saw the card for the therapist at the clinic right there. And that explained everything. He saw that card. He decided that I had gone crazy, without even asking me. He assumed, just like the guys who attacked me in 2005. They didnt ask me, did I call the police? The guy that called the police was inside. They didnt even talk to him. These guys--not only are they the sickest pieces of shit that God screwed up and ever created, they dont even ask the first question. All this guy had to ask me was, what happened? He didnt. He just assumed. Then he saw the card, and he assumed that I had gone crazy. He didnt know I had a roommate. He didnt know that my roommateyou cant get any more fucked up, okay? I:\tDid you interact with anyone directly, personally, after you left the hospital, or did you just go straight home? R:\tNo, I just came home. My roommate wasnt there. He didnt show up for two weeks, because he heard what happened. I:\tSo, when was the next time that you encountered a person? R:\tWhen I went to Central Station to get my drivers license back. I:\tCan you describe that? R:\tAnd they told me that [NAME]--I had to talk to him, and [NAME] didnt call me back for a week. And he called me back finally, and told me that he didnt take my drivers license. And I said, yeah, you did. And I said, and you arrested the wrong guy, you fucker. I:\tWhat was the first month out like after that hospital incident? R:\tI just wanted to die. My neighbors fucked me. My roommate fucked me. The police fucked me. The paramedic fucked me. The whole system fucked me. I just wanted to die. Who wouldnt? I live in a sea of shit. We live in a cesspool tank. I hate to be the one to tell you, but those are the facts. These people are the scum of the fucking earth, man. And theyre supposed to be the good guys. Are you kidding me? What would you think if it happened to you? Youre lucky it didnt. God, the whole worlds on their fucking cell phones--unbelievable--and all their devices, everybody--unbelievable, unbelievable. And Im the one that doesnt have a life. Thats funny. Thats funny. I:\tIs there anything else that you would like to tell me more about your experiences immediately after that hospital incident? R:\tYeah, the OCC. I called up and filed a complaint. And theyre supposed to give you a copy of your report, okay? I have every piece of paper. I dont make this shit up. And they didnt give me a copy. They realized that this cop had fucked up, okay? So, they did their job. They protected the fucking piece of shit. Thats their job. Nobody works for the victims. Do you understand this? Do you get it? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. R:\tNobody works for the victims. They work for the police. Theyre supposed to be working for the victims. They work for the police, and they realized immediately that this cop had seriously fucked up big time. So, they just completely flushed me down the toilet. And I was supposed to get an appointment. I didnt get an appointment. They cancelled everything as soon as they realized what happened. That is what they do. The cops--every one of their bases is covered. The other cops dont turn them in. Its their code. The department protects them. The OCC, who works supposedly for the victims, works for the cops, and makes sure that the cops get away with it, because they dont want 10,000 lawsuits and the city would be bankrupt, okay? And youre toast. Youre just a piece of shit. How am I supposed to feel? I live in a cesspool tank full of pure shit. I:\tWhat was the most difficult adjustment during that period of time? R:\tThere isnt. There isnt. What happened was, it was sort of funny because an old friend of mine--he said, this place is--youre rotting. Youve been fucked, and fucked, and fucked. He says, youve got to get out of here. And he came down and took me up to Ukiah, California. Its up north. And I was up there for maybe 10 days or something. And it was the only time that I forgot about everything. It was just beautiful. And it was funny, because after a week or so, his sister called him. And he was at the store, and I answered the phone. She lives in Hawaii. And I had forgotten about all of this filthy shit because I was in another world. And she said, I heard what those assholes did to you. And it hit me like a ton of bricks, because I had forgotten. Its the only time I had forgotten. And since I came back from Ukiah, I cant forget it because I watch TV. I watch all these shows. I watch all these shows showing how cops are the good guys and [02:46:32 unintelligible] and all that kind of shit. But when I was up there for those 10 days, I had completely forgotten. And ... I:\tWhat about any support that you may have received during this period of time? R:\tNone. I:\tNone from your family or ... R:\tNo. I:\tNo support? R:\tNo. And I stopped going to the clinic, because when I went to the clinic, I told the therapist. I said--this was everything I told you--everything I had told her. I told her my roommate was an asshole. My landlord was an asshole. My neighbors were assholes. And the police were assholes. I told her all this shit. And it just went right through her. And if I wouldnt have had that card on my dresser, then the cop wouldnt have come up with this whole thing. He just happened to see it. Do you understand? Thats how fucked up this guy was. He didnt ask me what happened. He just assumed. He didnt know I had a roommate. And then he saw this card on my dresser. If that card wouldnt have been on my dresser, he wouldnt have had me hauled away in an ambulance like a nutcase because he had just saw the card when he was stealing my drivers license. Yeah, the fucking asshole. You tell me that guy aint the sickest fuck. And heres the best part. He was the officer in charge. He was the brains of the outfit. This guy had shit for brains. Hes the stupidest piece of fuck that there is--and worse. And he was the officer in charge. I:\tWhat about any resources that you had access to [02:48:36 unintelligible]? Im just going to name some, and you can tell me if you had access to a service or a program similar to it that you can think of, okay? So, finding a place to live? R:\tIn San Francisco, I couldnt afford it. Ive been in rent control for 40 years up here. I:\tI mean, when you were released from the hospital during that time, did you have access to a program for any of this stuff, like finding a place to live? R:\tNo, no. I had an apartment already and a roommate. I:\tFinding a job? R:\tNo, I didnt have a job. I:\tYou didnt have access to any support for finding one, though? R:\tNo. I:\tFinding a means of transportation? R:\tNo. I:\tContinuing your education? Finding childcare? R:\tNo. I:\tFinding legal assistance? R:\tThey dont help people that are fighting the police. I:\tGetting drug or alcohol treatment? R:\tNope. I:\tAccessing healthcare, not including drug or alcohol treatment? R:\tNo. I:\tGetting counseling, including mental health treatment? R:\tWell, I went to the place, but they didnt help me. I:\tSo, you used the program, but it wasnt helpful. R:\tRight. I:\tGetting financial assistance? R:\tWell, I did. Eventually, I got on SSI. I:\tAnd you got help for getting on SSI after you were released [02:49:52 crosstalk]? R:\tYeah, no. This was after all this. I had applied for SSI because I was on General Assistance. And they told me to apply for SSI. I didnt know what SSI was. And then as I learned, what they do is, you fill out 10 tons of paperwork, and months go by, and they deny it. But nobody told me this at first, because thats what they do. Theyre waiting for you to die or give up. Its one of their tricks. And they use this trick. And they denied me the second time. Then the third time, I was referred to this lawyer, [NAME] down on Market Street. And I was referred to this place, and I got this lawyer. And it was this gal that knew all about this stuff. She was gold. She was a genius. She knew all about this shit. She knew how to deal with it. And she got me on SSI. We won the decision. And all of a sudden, instead of having $600 a month, I had $900 a month. And then they gave me back pay money, which was $10,000. I:\tBut this was not related to the incident ... R:\tNo, no, this was well after. Sorry; I apologize. I:\tWhat about obtaining photo ID? Did you have any help or assistance through a program finding that? What about working on personal relationships? R:\tI didnt have any personal--all my friends had died or moved away. I:\tWhat about [02:51:35 crosstalk] and maybe finding them, or helping to work on them--the ones that you did have, if any? R:\tNo. I:\tAny others that come to mind? R:\tNo. Like I said, they were either good friends, and they died, or they were fake friends. And once I realized that they were fake friends, you dont need fake friends, okay? Its a Joan Jett song. You got nothing to lose when you lose fake friends, okay? I love Joan Jett. Shes really cool. I:\tAre there any other programs that you wish were offered after your release from the hospital? R:\tNo. The only thing I wanted was to find a place outside of San Francisco or even here where I could live without a roommate, okay? And they couldnt help me. If you have children, youre on the top of the list. If youre homeless, youre on the list, but youre down. If youre not homeless, and you dont have kids, youre the bottom of the list. So, theyre not going to help you find a place unless youre homeless, see. I:\tHow did this time in the hospital affect your relationship with [02:53:01 unintelligible]? R:\tOh, nothing. I:\tNo change at all? R:\tNo, no. I:\tHow did they change, if at all? R:\tI just hated people. I:\tYour family members included, aside from your sisters? R:\tWell, yeah, some of my family members, too, yes. I couldnt believe that they didnt give a shit. If it wouldve happened to them, it wouldve been the crime of the fucking century. But it happened to me, and they didnt give a shit. And that was crushing, man. That really hurt. That really, really hurt. And thats why the two sisters that care about me are the most important things in my life. The rest of them, they can all go fuck themselves. I:\tWhat kind of supports did they provide you with? R:\tNone. I:\tNone? R:\tOn my own. I:\tWhat about any interactions with friends you had after that hospital incident? Were there any that come to mind? R:\tNo. The first incident, I told you. All my friends said that these guys were on drugs. The second incident in 2012--these guys were all gone or died. So, I really didnt have any friends at the time. I:\tSo, no interactions with any friends [02:54:27 at that time]? R:\tNo, there was nothing. I:\tSo, would you say that your relationships with friends, if any at that time, were not changed by the hospital incident? Have you had any criminal justice contact since completing your pretrial diversion program? R:\tNo. No, I didnt bring a bomb down there and blow up the Hall of Justice. I:\tSo, now Im going to ask you some questions about your housing situation. R:\tOh, boy. I:\tAbout how many places have you lived in the first year following your most recent release? So ... R:\tIve lived at [NAME] for 40 fucking years, man. Its rent control. And the landlord died, unfortunately, and hes got a son thats brain-dead. Hes a piece of shit, and I have to deal with his son. And hes such an asshole. And he wouldnt do anything. And I went to Housing Rights, the Tenants Union. I went to Hastings Law. And they all said, youre being harassed; sue him. Youre being harassed; sue him. But you cant get a lawyer, okay, for harassment. I didnt know this. In other words, if they tried to evict me, theres eviction lawyers that will help you, okay, because theyre getting paid, okay? Theyre getting paid to help you, okay? So, theyre already getting paid, just like the gal who helped me get on SSI. She was already getting paid. But harassment is different, and you need a lawyer. And the lawyers dont want to deal with it, because theyre not getting paid, and theyre not going to get much money out of it. And thats the way that this piece of shit got away. But they told me about the building inspector. And I called the building inspector, and the building inspector came over, and took a look at the place. And he said, oh, this is--and he took all these pictures, and he put a notice on the building, telling my landlord, you better fix this, or your ass is grass. And he had to fix it. Otherwise, he wouldnt have done nothing. I:\tSo, how would you describe your current living situation--and also the one that you had during that time? R:\tIts a horrible situation. I:\tI mean, not in terms of your relationships with people there, but is it your own place, your own apartment, or is it a family members place, or ... R:\tNo, its my apartment, but I have a roommate that I have to have, number one. Number two, you cant keep a car. Its very steep hills, so a bike is--you cant keep a pet. If the building wasnt dysfunctional--in other words, if I reported this building to the authorities, they would condemn the building, okay? So, I dont want to report it or get it condemned, because I have nowhere to go, okay? I:\tSo, those are some of the cons, but what about some of the pros, if any positives? R:\tNo. I:\tNo positives there? R:\tNo, the place is fucked. I:\tI mean, its rent-controlled, you said, though, right? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs that a positive in your opinion? R:\tWell, it was $300 when I moved in; now its $900. Is that rent control or what? It went from $300 to $900 under rent control. Its all a dirty trick. I:\tAnd did your contact with the criminal justice system make it more difficult to stay where you are or find new housing, would you say? R:\tThey didnt care about any of that. The people who were supposed to care was the clinic that I went to. But they couldnt help me. So, the justice system--they dont give a crap about nothing. I:\tSo, Im going to ask you some experiences about your neighborhood that you might have opinions about it--the way you feel, one, immediately following your release--and also today. So, one, in my first month out, I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live. Strongly agree to strongly disagree. R:\tDisagree. I:\tIn my first month out, it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tNo, it wasnt hard at all. I:\tSo, this is disagree or strongly disagree? R:\tNo, it wasnt a problem. I:\tDisagree, you would say? R:\tI guess. Whatever. I:\tIn my first month out, I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tYes, definitely, totally. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYes, my neighbors, and my landlord, and my roommate. I:\tThe ones that you were talking about earlier? R:\tRight. I:\tDrug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tNot a problem at all. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tNo. It used to be, but it changed. I:\tSo, disagree or strongly disagree? R:\tI disagree. It used to be, and now its not. Everybodys turned into a piece of shit. It seems to be a requirement. I:\tI cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions. R:\tWell, they were responsible for me getting tortured. I:\tSo, you would say agree or strongly agree? R:\tId say I hate them with a passion. In fact, the guy that cut my face open with a knife--he died. It was so funny. I said, gee, you know, this guy died, and I went to heaven--because he was such an asshole, and he tortured me. He belonged in an asylum. And when he died, everything improved. I:\tSo, [NAME], sticking to the questions, for this one, I cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions, you would say strongly agree? R:\tI dont give a shit what they think about me. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\tYeah. Theyre assholes. I:\tAnd if there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who live there could get it resolved. R:\tYeah, I guess so. I:\tAgree? R:\tI guess so. I:\tI expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tThats a tough one. I guess so, yeah. I:\tAgree? R:\tYeah. I mean, its not that I want to; its, I have no choice. I:\tSo, this is about your neighborhood today, these same set of questions. My neighborhood is a safe place to live. R:\tNo. I:\tDisagree or strongly disagree? R:\tDisagree. If you have a car, its going to be gone. Would you like that? I:\tNo. It is hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. Theres not a lot of trouble, but the whole city, theres trouble, okay? Theres lunatics marching around here. I mean, you put your clothes in the laundry; somebodys going to come and steal them or something. I mean, you know. I dont know what to say. I didnt expect all this stuff, but I:\tYeah, there are a lot of questions. R:\tYeah, no kidding. I:\tBut were just trying to get a thorough understanding of who you are and your perspectives on situations. Were almost done, though. Were almost done. R:\tOkay, well, its generally safe. But on the other hand, nothing is. I:\tSo, you would say neither agree nor disagree? R:\tI mean, I just had this friend of mine--his car was broken into. And I was talking to him, and he said two nights ago, he was at North Beach Pizza, and he came out of the place after eating his dinner, and three black kids came up to him with a gun and told him to give them his wallet, or they were going to put him out of his misery, okay? Are you getting this? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. R:\tDid you think thats safe? Is that a good thing? I:\tIt sounds dangerous. R:\tAnd they took his wallet, and then his car was broken into the next day. What a great place. Beautiful. I:\tFor now, I am nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tI dont know. Yes. I:\tAgree? R:\tYeah. I:\tDrug selling is a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tNo, not at all. I:\tDisagree or strongly disagree? R:\tDisagree. I:\tI think my neighborhood is a good place to live. R:\tNo. It used to be. I:\tDisagree? R:\tDisagree. It used to be. I:\tI care about what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tNo. I dont give a rats ass what they think. I hate them. I:\tStrongly disagree? If there is a problem in my neighborhood, people who live there can get it solved. R:\tYes, I think so. I:\tAgree? R:\tYeah. I:\tI expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tI guess so. I dont want to. Id move right now if I could, but I dont have a choice, do I? I dont have a choice. I:\tIs there anything else that you would like to add or talk about more related to that set of questions? R:\tNo, not at all. I:\tAnd you didnt have a job following your release, right, in 2012? R:\tNo. I:\tDid you search for work during that period of time? R:\tWell, after I was beaten up in 2005, I couldnt do anything. It took me over a year, man, to recover. And by the time I recovered, nobody would hire me. I went online. I did everything I could do. And nobody would hire me. Its a shame. Its a crime. I:\tSo, you did search for work, but you did not find any? R:\tOh, yeah, absolutely. Yes, yes, absolutely. I should be working right now, for craps sakes, man. I:\tHow many hours a week would you say you search for work, then? R:\tOh, boy. Well, its all done online. And it took me all night to look for work online. I didnt know how to go through the procedures. And I had no one to help me, of course. And I got through this step. And the next step took me hours to get by. And I finally got through the next step, and it turned out there was another step, and another step. I:\tI know what you mean. R:\tAnd I just couldnt deal with it. Im on my own, and I have nobody to help me do anything. I:\tHow many hours per week would you say you spend searching for work [03:06:31 crosstalk]? R:\tOh, fuck, I dont know. I:\tOne to five, six to ten, eleven to twenty ... R:\tAt least one to five. I:\tAnd per week, roughly how many applications would you submit, would you say? R:\tI didnt. I didnt know how to. I may have. I:\tOne to five, maybe? R:\tI may have, a couple of times. But I dont even know, man. Its all just different online. My whole life was not online, okay? You read the newspaper ads. You went to the place. It wasnt done on fucking line, okay? It was different. It was just different. I:\tWould you say you submitted at least, on average, one application per week, though, at a guess? R:\tYes. I tried to. I:\tAnd if you were to qualify it, how much effort have you expended toward your search for work? A lot, some, a little? R:\tI expended a lot at first, but once I realized what was happening, you know--the guy who gave me my computer and showed me how to use it originally, he said one thing to me. He said, dont get pissed off. He said, everybody who has a computer gets pissed off. They want to get a hammer, and beat the shit out of their computer. He said, dont get mad, you know. He said, you got to think it over, and take your time, take a break, have a cigarette; dont get mad. And, oh, man, it was tough for me. It was really challenging, really challenging. No one to help me. And its so impersonal. A phone call is personal. Going to the place is personal. Filling out an application--doing things online is impersonal; its different. Its just different. I:\tTo what extent would you say you agree with the following statement? Having a criminal record has made it very difficult for me to find work. R:\tOh, no, uh-uh. I:\tSo, strongly disagree? R:\tYeah. No, that hasnt been a problem, no. I:\tCan you explain that? R:\tWell, number one, I didnt really get convicted of anything, you know. I was let go, and let go, and let go. I mean, you know, it didnt have anything to do with anything. I:\tDo you think, had you been convicted more times, that it wouldve had an effect on your employment situation? R:\tOh, no. If I wouldve had a job, it wouldve been serious. But I didnt. In other words, if I wouldve had a job when they pulled this crap on me, that wouldve been it. Boom, gone, no job. I:\tI know you described your goals for what youd like to do, moving out of San Francisco, but where do you see yourself in terms of work and employment in the next year, five years, and ten years? R:\tLike I told you, if I moved out to another place, I think I would have a good chance of getting a job. But here, no. Just like getting a date; Im not going to get a date here. But if I leave town, I could get a date, okay? The women are different, okay? I would have a date, and I would have a job. In other words, I would have a life. But I dont have a life here. I:\tSo, how do you plan to achieve these goals that you mentioned? R:\tI dont plan to. Ive already tried everything. I mean, I went up north. And when I was up there, the good thing about the computer--I had a computer at that time that I used--you would push in the newspapers--Fort Bragg, Ukiah--and at home, I could read the paper. It was unbelievable, cool as fuck. And thats when I realized that the rents up there werent cheap. Theyre really expensive. I was stunned. And no smoking and no pets. And Im going, what kind of fucking crap is this, man? You want me to pay this much money to live up here, and I cant smoke in my place, and I cant keep a pet. Are you kidding me? But it was kind of cool to be able to do that, to read the paper. And so I got some kind of feel for what was going on, even though I wasnt up there, you know. And plus, I was going to try and move into a travel trailer, because I couldnt afford a house, but I could move into a trailer. So, I went online, and I learned all kinds of stuff about RVs and travel trailers. I didnt know anything about this shit. But I learned really a lot. So, the computer did help me learn some stuff like that. But as far as jobs, it didnt work out at all. I:\tIs there anything else you want to add or talk about more related to that set of questions? R:\tNo. I:\tThe next set of questions is about your financial situation following your most recent release. You said that you have not incurred any debt related to your contact with the criminal justice system. In general, how would you say your financial criminal justice obligations have affected your life, if at all? R:\tNot at all. Not the criminal part; the financial part, obviously it affects your life if you dont have any ... I:\tCan you give me some examples for you in particular? R:\tWell, having to live on GA and food stamps--are you kidding me--and stuck with a roommate that you dont want to live with. I:\tYou said thats not necessarily related to the criminal justice system, though, those financial obligations. R:\tNo, no, no, no, no, no. I:\tIs there anything else you would like to add or talk about more related to that set of questions? R:\tId like to smoke a cigarette. That would be nice. I:\tYou can take a break if you would like. Yeah, we could pause it. So, risk and needs assessment. This section is about the process by which you were assessed for the diversion program you participated in. Did you participate in a pretrial diversion program? R:\tNot that I know of. I:\tAnd this incident where you were in the hospital--there was no diversion program that you were informed about, or R:\tNo. I:\tSo, is there anything else that is important that is going on in your life right now that we have not talked about? R:\tI dont know if we talked about it, but the mental torture has not gone away, okay? Like I said, if I moved away and had a life, I would move on, and I wouldnt dwell on it. But since I cant do that, Im dwelling on it. And I dont want to dwell on it. I want to forget it. I want to leave it in the past, see, but I cant do that. Im telling you, once this has happened to you, and you know whats going on, its like carrying a cross. I feel like Jesus with a crown of thorns, carrying a cross around, okay? Thats what it feels like when this happens to you. Its not pretty. And the advice that I got--to move on and let it go--has not worked with me. Its been really bad. And I dont want to hate people, but what it is is what it is. Its undeniable. And when these things happen to you, it happened, okay? You put Barack Obama in here, and sit him down, and Ill bury him. Ill bury him in reality. Ill put him in his place. He wouldnt know whether to shit or go blind, because he would know that I know. And once you know, its not good things to know. Its really bad to see that these guys get away with their crimes, that theyre protected, that if you file a complaint, they work for the police; everything about it is just bad. And its bad for everybody. And its bad for the whole department. Its just bad, okay? And the worst thing, I guess, is, nobodys going to do nothing about it. Its not going to change. Theyre saying that theyre changing it. Theyre saying that theyre cleaning it up. No, theyre not. Maybe they are, but not really. I:\tSo, youve given us a lot to consider during this interview, and I appreciate that. Do you have any questions for me? R:\tWell, yeah. So, you go to [NAME], and you look like youre maybe a junior? I:\tIve actually graduated college already, yeah. R:\tOh, you did? Oh, okay. Oh, good for you. I:\tIm in a doctoral program, so Ive been working on a PhD. R:\tOh, good for you. Oh, congratulations. I:\tThank you. Thank you. R:\tAnd so how did you get stuck with a lunatic like me, asking me a bunch of questions? I:\tWell, I dont think youre a lunatic, but this is for the pretrial diversion and detention study that were doing. And we got your contact information from the San Francisco pretrial diversion project. R:\tIve never even heard of it. I was stunned when they told me about this. I:\tSo, you havent had any experiences with pretrial diversion? R:\tNo, I dont know what theyre talking about. And in fact, I dont know how you got my number, because, like I said, what they do is, they sweep this stuff under the rug. They dont want people talking about this kind of stuff, right? I:\tWere you ever told that the time that you spent in the hospital was a type of detention, perhaps? That you were ... R:\tNo, no. Nobody ever told me nothing. I just woke up after I was drugged by a psycho lunatic paramedic, and kidnapped, and tortured, and came to in the psych ward at [NAME]. I didnt know where I was. I didnt know how I got there. I didnt know what time it was or what day it was. I knew nothing. I:\tAnd there was no trial after the time that you spent in the hospital, the 10 hours? And there was no mention of a trial at any point? R:\tNo, I told you. I:\tJust making sure. R:\tI missed a court date because I didnt get the citation. The filthy, fucking piece of shit wrote me a citation, and he signed it. I never got it. And if I wouldnt have called the DAs Office over and over, I wouldnt have even known. How could I? I couldnt possibly know, because I never got the citation, because this piece of shit pulled this crap. And not only did he kidnap me and torture me, he stole my drivers license and wrote me a citation that he never gave me. Thats the bottom. Thats a piece of shit. He should be taken out and fucking shot. And thats just me. We dont know what other victims that these criminals pull their crap on, okay? You got to keep that in mind. Thats just me. I:\tWell, some of the things weve talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable topics. Were there any topics or questions that you thought were particularly uncomfortable? If so, do you have any suggestions for how we might ask those questions more effectively? R:\tNo, no. Basically, from what I can see, youre beating your head against the wall. Youre not going to make any difference. Nothings going to change. Its all controlled, and nobodys going to do anything about it. And innocent people that dont have money are tortured and treated worse than any dog. And thats the facts, and thats the way it is. I:\tDo you think that its not possible to do anything about it, or just that people wont do anything about it? R:\tBoth. I:\tCould you describe that and explain it a bit more for me? R:\tIts impossible, because they have all their bases covered. They dont want 10,000 lawsuits. Do you understand this? If they paid me for what they did to me, they would owe me so much money--thats just me. The city would be bankrupt 100 times over. They dont want lawsuits. And lawyers dont want to fight the cops. Theyre divorce lawyers, the dog bite, anything that they can make money on, okay? Fighting the police--they dont like that idea. Theyre not going to make money, and theyre going to lose, because the cops [03:21:13 got all in the department]. And the justice system has all their bases covered, all of their bases covered. I:\tOkay, thank you. To help you get in touch with us and also to keep in touch with you for further questions, we would like to ask you for contact information on family members or friends who are close to you. Can you please give us their names, addresses, and phone numbers [03:21:38 crosstalk]? R:\tNo, they dont want to deal with it. I:\tNo? R:\tNo. I dont even know if I do. I mean, I appreciate being able to tell my story somewhat to somebody who cares. And I appreciate that, that you came over, and listened to this stuff, okay, and spent your whole day doing this--and actually gave me money. I cant believe that.

      " I:\tSo we'll just start with background questions. How old are you? R:\tI'm 63. I:\tAnd what date were you born? R:\t1953. Yeah, that adds up right. I:\tAnd the month and the day? R:\tFebruary 7. I:\tSame day as my brother. R:\tReally? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. He's a '97, though. He's younger than I am. Where were you born? R:\tJersey City, New Jersey. I:\tAnd are you a US citizen? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd if you could, choose from this list of categories what you self-identify as and how people characterize you. R:\tNow this is only in California. I found this out when I moved to California. I:\tHow so? R:\tIt turns out that in California, Italians are not considered white people. I:\tAnd was that something you experienced in the Bay Area or other parts? R:\tAll over California, up and down the whole statePortland to LA. I:\tInteresting. R:\tYeah. On the East Coast, before I moved out here, I would have just checked white. Doesn't work here. I:\tAnd was that something that you experienced in job, or education, or housing? R:\tWell, I work for myself, but what would happen is, peopleespecially in Silicon Valleywould hang out outside my cube and tell Italian jokes. In fact, once I was gassing up in Santa Rosa, and this woman started yelling and screaming at me because she thought I overtook her for some reason, where she came in the wrong direction; I came in the right direction. And she's, what kind of person are you? Why, you're not even white. Other voice: Well, she was calling you white trash. R:\tOh, she was calling me white trash. OV:\tAnd then she looked at you, and she said, you're not even white. It was the weirdest thing. R:\tSo that's why you have that answernot white. I:\tWhat is your present marital status? R:\tI'm married. I:\tAnd do you have any children? R:\tI met my daughter when she was 21. So do I have her or not? I:\tDo you consider her a daughter of yours? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo one daughter? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd how old is she now? R:\tForty OV:\tForty-three. R:\tForty-three. That's right. There's exactly 20 years between us. I:\tAnd if you don't mind me asking, why did you only meet her when she was 21? R:\tHer mother wanted to raise her with her wife. I didn't even know she existed. I:\tSo you didn't know, and then she contacted you later? R:\tNo, I found out, and I contacted her when she turned 21, because when I tried looking for her, the mother would not let me see her. I:\tAnd was that just because you didn't want you at all involved? R:\tShe didn't want me to know anything about what was going on. Back then, we didn't have gay rights amendment. I:\tAnd sort of off topic at this point, but what is your highest level of education? R:\tI have a grammar school diploma. But I have seven years of college. High school, four years of Jesuit prison, you know, but I gave them back the diploma. And [name] threatened me with a degree, but I didn't finish one basket-weaving course on purpose, because I don't have respect for the state of the academic system in the United States. I:\tCan you describe a little bit for me how that works? R:\tI'm very smart. I only go to the courses I want to go to. I only do the work that I want to. I learn for real. You know, I don't spit out test stuff; I learn. And, you know, most of the academics can't cope with that. For instance, I am a decorated computer technologist. I mean, I have multiple patents. I invented multimedia, okay? And I took one computer course. And because I did for the assignment something that I could use that was exactly what the assignment wasbut it wasn't exactly what he asked forhe failed me on the course. I was already at [name] working on the Unix operating system at the time. That probably doesn't mean anything to you, but it's ... I:\tI recognize the name. R:\tMe and Al Gore invented the internet. I connected to the internet in 1973. That was the first time I logged onto it. You know, I wrote some of the technical specifications for the internet. I:\tSo you didn't find what you wanted in the academic requirements, is what you're saying. R:\tIf I had a teacher that wanted to teach, I'd get along famously. I'd get an A. If I had a teacher that just wanted a regurgitating student, it wouldn't work. It wouldn't happen. I:\tAnd that happened mostly in your college years or R:\tThrough my whole lifetime. I gave my first lecture tour at the age of five on the planets, on Kepler's laws, and the state of the solar system, distribution of solar radiation across the planet causing seasonsfive years old. And then the nuns made me very popular by making me repeat my lecture in first through eighth grades. I:\tSo you went to a Catholic school at the time? R:\tA Catholic grammar school, yes, with nuns and  I:\tFor how long? R:\tWell, they left me back. So it should have been nine years, and I was in there for ten. Yeah, they left me back in kindergarten, mostly because the kids kept on beating me up. I was small, not like today. I:\tSo was that all the way through high school? R:\tHigh school, I have not seen anybody from my high school since the day I left. I:\tSo grammar school, high school, and then some college. R:\tThe colleges are sevennot seven colleges; more like four or fivebut cherry-picking courses. I spent three years at [name] because they were paying me very well. And I was, at the same time, working for [name]. And in 1973, I was making over $20 an hour, which, back then, translates to about $160 today. So yeah, and that success has never stopped. I:\tSo again a little bit off topicdid you receive any help in school with academics, like tutoring or anything like that? R:\tI would tutor people. I:\tYou would tutor people, but you didn't receive any help yourself? R:\tDidn't need it. I:\tAnd how do you support yourself financially? R:\tI own my own company. So what choice is that? I:\tI'm going to say jobs, yeah. R:\tOkay. I:\tAnd about how much do you earn? R:\tNorth of $300,000. I:\tAnd that's per year, I assume? R:\tYeah. OV:\tThat's not every year, dear. R:\tNot every year, but this year. OV:\tIt's feast and famine for you, dear. It always has been. R:\tYeah, we'll get into the famine. I:\tSo the next block of questions are about relationships and social support. We consider family to be blood or legal relatives. And I'm going to read you some statements, and you can say strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, so on and so forth. \"I feel close to my family.\" R:\tTrue. Oh, strongly agree. I:\t\"I want my family to be involved in my life.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t\"I consider myself a source of support for my family.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t\"My family is a source of support for me.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t\"I fight a lot with my family members.\" R:\tNot a lot. Put it at above one above smallest. You know, nobody has an ideal family, and we do have our squabbles, but they never last. I:\t\"I often feel like a disappointment to my family.\" R:\tNo. Strongly disagree. I:\t\"I am criticized a lot by my family.\" R:\tCriticized is different than joking around, so I strongly disagree with that, yeah. We're an Italian family. I don't know if you know what that means. I:\tI am familiar with the stereotype, yeah. \"I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.\" R:\tYeah, strongly agree. I:\tAnd about how many people do you feel that way towards? R:\tWell, my immediate family. That's five. My wifethat's six. Okay, six. I:\t\"I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.\" R:\tTrue; I strongly agree. I:\tAnd about how many do you feel that towards? R:\tHalf of themthree, four, yeah. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.\" Not that you need it R:\tDon't need it. I:\tBut would they help you, should you come into a circumstance like that? R:\tThey'd have me move in with them. I:\tSo strongly agree? R:\tI wouldn't do it. I:\tAnd how many people would offer you a place? R:\tI think every single one of them, yeah, if it came down to something like that, you know. I:\t\"I have someone in my life who would provide help or advice on finding a job,\" should you need it. R:\tYeah, put that one in the middle, okay? Because they don't travel in the spheres of the people that employ me, okay? I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or support with dealing with a health problem. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd about how many would you say? R:\tAll of them. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide transportation or some form of a ride to work or a ride to appointments.\" R:\tI've told you about the car already, didn't I? We use public transportation all the time. Then everybody else is on the other coast. I:\tNeutral? R:\tNeutral. Yeah, it's a nonapplicable question, really. I:\tYeah, because you use other forms of transportation. R:\tYeah. I:\t\"I have someone in my family who would provide me with financial support.\" R:\tAbsolutely true. I:\tAnd about how many do you feel that towards? R:\tI'd say all of them, if I ever needed anything. If I asked them for moneyif any of them asked me for money, they have money. If I ask any of them for money, I'll have money, you know. Money does not drive my family, even though it's a fairly wealthy family. I:\tSo the next couple questions are going to be open response. So family and friends can be sources of good, positive support, or they can be stressful and destructive influences. Can you give me an example of your family or your friends as being a positive influence on you? R:\tI'll give you an anecdote; how's that? I:\tOkay, perfect. R:\tA company I'm working for now is a global company. I'm doing a task that requires me to, you know, travel the whole world. And I went to London. I was assigned to, you know, go to London. And I picked up the phone, told my mom, hey, I'm headed for London. And she immediately said, when you're in London, go to the Museum of Art. I want to see pictures of this exhibit, this exhibit, and this exhibit. And she's going to be 89 years old on Saturday, okay? Didn't look up anything; it was all in her head, you know. So there's the anecdote for you. I:\tAnd can you give me an example of when your family or your friends were a bad influence or a destructive source for you? R:\tEvery single person in this complex is not a nice person and willfully destructive towards me. We're getting there. I:\tAnd for the purpose of the transcript, this is a condominium? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd you mentioned earlier that you have one child; you have a daughter. R:\tYes. I:\tHow would you describe your relationship with her now? R:\tMore than she wants, and less than I want. When you grow up your whole life, and your mom doesn't tell you anything about your dadexcept not nice thingsyou can't shake that. It's taken me quite a while to come to that accommodation, you know. I get to see my grandkid on Facebook, you know, three, four times a year. And that's got to be enough for me. I wanted to install aand she does call, and she does, you know, put the kid on Facebook. You know, we have a good conversation, you know. We don't argue. It's senseless to argue with your daughter. I wanted to put a Beam in her house. You know what a Beam is? I:\tYes. R:\tThey have household Beams now. So I wanted to put a Beam in the house so I could go visit. It took her less than a quarter of a second to say no, okay? As I said, you know, more than what she wants, but less than what I want. Yeah. I:\tAnd does she live near here, or R:\tShe lives in Jupiter, Florida. I:\tSo that's all the way across. R:\tOh, yeah, that's about as far as you could get fromthe only place you could be further away is Seattle. I:\tAnd how often do you see her, if she's living that far away? R:\tAlmost once a year, because we meet on neutral turf, mostly. I:\tWhat's neutral turf? R:\tMy mom has a condominium in Florida, besides the house inwell, I said Manhattan before; it's actually Bayonne, New Jersey, which is closer to Manhattan than most of the other boroughs. Yeah, we spend a holiday over at my mom's house. I:\tSo Thanksgiving or Christmas? R:\tYeah, or sometimes, you know, just sabbatical time. She's married to an academic. I:\tAnd how would you describe how much you're involved in her life? R:\tVery little. I:\tVery little? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo the next set of questions are about people outside your family. These are going to be the friends that you feel closest to. How many friends, up to three, do you feel closest to? R:\tUp to three? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. And these are outside romantic or blood ties. R:\tRight, right. Oh, I don't knowwork included? I:\tSure. R:\tThree. I:\tAnd can you help me fill these out? R:\tLet me grab that for a minute, so I don't have to clip it off andpresbyopia. I'm sure you've heard of that. I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. R:\tIt's really amazing. My far vision has gotten a lot better. For your third friendwe're starting with the third? I:\tYeah, it counts down, for some reason, on the R:\tWhat is the difference between Native American and Hispanic? I:\tNative American is American Indian, so that's like Cherokee or R:\tHow about South American? Are they Hispanic, or are they Native American? She's Venezuelan. I:\tI would say that's more Hispanic. R:\tShe doesn't, at all. I:\tIf she doesn't identify that way, you can ... R:\tI'll put Venezuelan, because that's what she identifies asif I could spell Venezuelan. I:\tI can do it if you want to. R:\tI'm not sure, but I thinkdid [name] ever graduate college, dear? OV:\tNo, I don't think so. R:\tOh, yeah, she is. She's working for pay. Yeah, she's a polyglot. OV:\tI know she went to college in Germany. R:\tShe did go to college in Germany and France. [Name], grab an iPad with her keyboard on it. The two guys are as white as white bread, really. Fifty-three, maybe? I'm guessing there. Oh no, no, I mixed up one and two here. That one's a college graduateand yes. OV:\tWell, I don't have [00:21:35 inaudible]. R:\tGrab my iPad. OV:\tYour iPad? R:\tYeah, the big one. Are you a polyglot? I:\tTo be honest, I'm not familiar with the term. R:\tOh, it's somebody who speaks more than one language. I:\tOh, I wish. No. Never something I learned as a child. R:\tYeah, currently, she speaks five languages. I:\tYour Venezuelan friend? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow did you meet her? R:\tMutual friend brought her here. And she invented this. I:\tDo you want me to turn it towards you? R:\tThat's okay. I can operate it upside-down. Come on, go away. Go. Boy, theyremind me later. That's a keyboard that covers 36 different Latin-based languages. I:\tLatin-based languages? R:\tAll the European languages are in there. So you know, if you need the ... I:\tThat's wonderful. R:\tDone. There. I:\tI think social security counts for us, because that is money that comes from the government, not from ... R:\tIt's not public aid, though. He earned it. That's a big difference, you know. I:\tYeah, it is. R:\tIt's not public aid. I'm going to say no. I:\tOkay, that's fine. R:\tAnd they're both still alive, which is very happy for me. I:\tSo the next block of questions are on affiliations with groups or organizations. R:\tOh, this is going to be easy. I:\tAre you affiliated with any church or religious organization? R:\tNo. I:\tRecreational club? R:\tNope. I:\tSports team? R:\tNope. I:\tMusic or artist group? R:\tNope. I:\tCrew or gang? R:\tNope. I:\tLocal government? R:\tNo. I:\tCivic association? R:\tNope. I:\tSupport group? R:\tNope. I:\tAny other group or affiliation? R:\tNope. I:\tThat was quick. So the next block of questions are going to be on employment. How old were you when you had your first job? R:\tNewspaper boy count? I:\tYeah. R:\tTen. I:\tAnd was that back in New Jersey or R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd at what point did you move to California? R:\tI moved here in 1977. So I guess I was 24, yeah. I:\tYou've been here for a while. R:\tOh yeah, yeah. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life have you been employedall, most, some, little? R:\tAll; self. I:\tSelf-employed for all of that? R:\tYes. I founded a company, but that's still self-employed. I:\tSo what skills do you feel like you bring to the labor market, and how did you learn them? R:\tSelf-learned computer genius. I say that with an absolute straight face. I don't work for an Apple Bar, really. I:\tSo at what point were you given access to computers? R:\tI built my first computer in 1959. I:\tAnd so you just continuously built and R:\tAnd then I built another computer that's a model of the one I built in 1963, sitting on the piano there, that red thing. It doesn't look like a computer, honest. I:\tNo, it doesn't. R:\tThat's a digital computer. That's my first digital computer. The first one I built was analog, when I was six years old. That one, I built when I was 10 years old. That was a digital one. It was a kit. And then the next one I got my hands on was when I was 14. My father bought a complex bookkeeping machine that was programmable. And he let me take it apart and program it at night. I:\tAnd did you ever get to do anything with the bookkeeping machine? R:\tYeah, I printed a Christmas tree. And I guess that was '68, '69, probablymaybe even '67yeah, '68, something like that. I:\tAnd was three anyone that helped you ... R:\tNo. I:\t get any of these things? R:\tNo. I:\tWere you able to afford the computer parts and everything, or did you go to a school and find those? R:\tI had my paper boy job, and then my second job was a cabana boy, which made a bit more than a paper boy. You know what a cabana boy is? I:\tYeah. R:\tAnd then my next job was working for my father when I was 14. I:\tAnd what did he do? R:\tMy father owned the third-largest oil company in New Jersey. And I was put on the trucks first with his master plumber; then with his master electrician; then with his master HVAC. And I learned all those skills. I:\tAnd how long did you stay doing that? R:\tI worked for my dad until I was finished with collegewell, not finished with college; finished with my dad19. I:\tAnd then where did you go from there? R:\tI worked for three months for another HVAC company, and then [name] hired me. I:\tAnd how long were you at [name]? R:\tAbout three or four years, something like that. And I was at [name] at the same time. I was the manager of HEL for [name]. I:\tAnd describe that for me. R:\tHuman Experimental Laboratory. I:\tAnd how did you get into that position? R:\tI was studying art, and the psychology department had no place to put their HEL. And it was a computer-based system. And I was walking by, and I saw a computer with all sorts of graphic stuff on it. And I walked in, and now my number-one friend in that list was sitting there at a Selectric terminal, and he was writing APL. And I said, can we do our art on this computer? And he looks at me, you know. It's the first time we've ever set eyes on each other. And he goes, you want to do art? And I go, yeah, yeah, graphics, you know. He goes, can you program? I say, oh, I can definitely program. And he goes, okay, but you have to program for me. I said, fine. A year later, I was managing the laboratory, hired by [name]. I wrote the first tachistoscope program that ran from a computer. It's doing the Sternberg tasknowhat's the name of that task? The one where you measure the thinking time of the subject. You use a tachistoscope to do it. I:\tYeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, but I can't think of the name, either. R:\tYeah. So I wrote the first one. Then [name] heard about that. They hired me to do a tachistoscope for [name]. And then [name] heard about me, and they invited me to work on the Unix program. And then [name] heard about me, and he wanted me to work on the Music V program with him. I was the first person to make live computer music on a computer in 1972. And then [name] asked me to work on his digital synthesizer. I've done a lot of digital synthesizers, okay? But that's how it happens. I mean, you get a good break at the start. And my advertising technique was to have an unlisted phone number. I:\tAn unlisted phone numberwhat does that mean? R:\tOh, you guys don't remember phone books, do you? I:\tWell, we had phone books, but they were more used for kindling the fire and stuff. R:\tYeah, yeah. At one time, the phone book was what you used, okay? I:\tSo yours was not listed in the phone book. R:\tMy name was passed person to person, usually at the executive level of companies. I worked for [name], [name], [name]you know, all the biggies. And I've done a lot of life-critical programming. I:\tAnd are there any skills that you want to learn in the future at this point? R:\tThere's no end to computer science. I mean, I'm a researcher. And I was hired by this current company to do something nobody's ever done before. And, you know, I'll be finished in December for this project, and they turned around and saidand they took me out of retirement, basicallyand they said, can you give us another three years? Because they have more projects that are \"impossible to do.\" You know, that's been my whole mark. I've always done stuff with computers that nobody thought that they could do. I:\tAnd so they want you working until December, but ... R:\tOn this project. And then they said, do you have more years you could give us? Yeah, so that's a steady customer. Usually, steady customers hang out and bring me back. You know, one of the best things I heardI was invited to a meeting at one of my older customers, and they said, why don't we just pull the pin on [name] and throw him at it? I:\tSo have you experienced any barriers to employment, such as these? R:\tAs any of these? I:\tAnd you can choose more than one. R:\tI've always worked when I wanted to work. I always took a year off every decade, just to find out who I was. I:\tAnd you were mostly self-employed? R:\tYeah, essentially, I'm a purchase order. I:\tAnd how many jobs would you say you currently hold? R:\tRight now? I:\tYeah. R:\tWell, we just finished the keyboard. I consider that a job. It's a mentoring job for [name]. And, you know, the main thing is, you know, for my current client. And I very, very rarely do more than one major client at a timeonly when they insist, and both clients know that I'm splitting my time. I:\tSo two projects right now? R:\tActually, just one. We just finished the one. But I'm still her advisor. So you could count it as two. I:\tAnd what would you say your job title was? R:\tComputer Consultantvery simple. I:\tAnd when did you start as a computer consultant for yourself? R:\tAt [name]. I:\tAnd what year was that? R:\tMust have been '73 or so, maybe '74. I:\tAnd would you consider it a full or a part-time job? R:\tIt's fulltime when I'm working, yeah. I mean, often, I wind up, you know, working with crews around the world. So yeah, it's all hours sometimes. I:\tAnd how would you say you found this job? So how were you able ... R:\tI have a natural predilection to making computers do exactly what I want them to do. If you want to hear the mystic version of it ... I:\tSay whatever you'd like. R:\tI make computer random enough to work the way we want it to. I:\tAnd is that typical of the jobs that you've had in the past? R:\tYeah. Well, except for working for my dad, you know. But that was summer work. That wasn't fulltime work. That was, you know, a kid working for his dad, you know. I:\tThe majority of your life, though, you've been working computers and ... R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd in general ... R:\tWas never a fry cook. I:\tIn general, how would you describe your experiences in the job market so far? R:\tI've had a blessed career. And don't take that in the religious sense. You know, I've had a lucky career, but it's not luck. I've been rewarded for my hard work very well. I:\tAnd what is your typical environment for work? R:\tThat room over theredid you see it? I:\tSo you've been working ... R:\tI mostly work at home. If I work at the company, I generally get used as a resource by the other people, and it doesn't get my job done. I:\tAnd earning-wise, have you been making ... R:\tI've been making plus money for my whole life, yeah. I:\tAnd could you tell me about your most positive work experience? R:\tOh, there's so many of them. Let me put it this way, okay? Did you see the film \"The Imitation Game\"? I:\tYes. R:\tYou know when they're all gathered around the computer, and it works for the first time? I:\tMm-hmm [yes]. R:\tI've been in that situation at least six times in my life. I:\tWith new projects? R:\tWith something that works for the first time that changes the world. I've been thereit's more than anybody ever deserves. I mean, all those people at [name], you know, that was their only experience like that. I've had that experience more times than it's really fair for one person to have. I:\tAnd how would you describe that feeling? R:\tIt gives a moment to see the future. You know, one of them was a catheter that snaked inside of the heart, that let them actually do work on the heart without cracking the ribcage. And, you know, for a flashand it's imagination, but for a flash, you see how many people's lives you've saved. You know, you couldn't crack their cage; they'd be dead before you could close. Or the space shuttlesuddenly, the astronaut doesn't have to look down at the instruments; he's looking out the window, and his entire display cluster is there. I mean, it's an amazing feeling. I:\tSo on the opposite end, how would you describe your most negative experience? R:\tWorking with the Chinese. Definitely working with the Chinese. I:\tWhat is it about that that made it negative? R:\tTheir techniques of computer programming are hit and miss. There is no computer science about them. It is strictly, you know, keep on shoving things into the holes, and see if they work. In fact, one of my clientswhich one was it? It was [name]. Strike that. I:\tNo, it's okay. Then all names and companies will be ... R:\tI'm trying not to use names, okay? One of the companiesI told them immediately they were making a mistake by switching a part of the development overseas. And let's put it this way: In the court hearings that happened three years later, the attorney on my client's side said, were you enjoying your work? And I said, no. It turned into a whole nightmare. He goes, was there anybody telling you not to work there anymore? And I looked at him, and I said, you mean besides my wife? And even the opposition broke up on that one. I mean, you know, I think about three days later, they settled. I:\tAnd you emphasized the word science. What do you mean? What does computer science mean to you? R:\tComputer science means that you map out all of the things that the program's going to do, how it's going to do it, and especiallydo you ever play chess? I:\tI did, yeah. R:\tSo you played fairly seriously? You know what MCO is? I:\tI do not, no. R:\tHave you ever played againstthis is something I did in high school, you know. I was on the chess team. But have you ever seen somebody play multiple boards? I:\tYes. R:\tThat is how computers are done. They don't look at, you know, the whole sequence of the game; they look at the position. And a computer doing a program is a series of positions. You have to map those out very carefully, and in detail, and not have any of your pawns drop off the board. And that's computer science. Right now, I'm so disgusted with the state of thethere is no state of the art anymore. I mean, it's keep on hacking the code until it doesn't break as much, you knowwhereas, you know, I'm used to doing code that, if it does break, somebody dies. I:\tAnd you're talking about technological world today as being just hacking and R:\tYeah, because, you know, what is it? One thing that's hiring most programmers right nowwebsites. And who cares if the website breaks? Doesn't matter. Well, there are websites where somebody might die. And even those aren't, I think, sufficiently computer scienced. But that's my opinion. I:\tIs there anything more you'd like to add to that subject? R:\tRepeat the question again, from the top? I:\tIs there anything more you'd like to add to that subject? R:\tNo, not that ... I:\tYour employment experiences. R:\tOh, the bad employment experiencesyeah, okay, no. We're fine with that. Yeah, I think I gave you a good overall view. I:\tSo the next couple questions are on substance abuse. Have you ever had a drinking and/or drug problem? R:\tNo. I:\tWere they ever a minor part of your life? R:\tI drink half a bottle of wine a day. I split a bottle of wine with my wife. And occasionally, I'll drink a whole bottle. I:\tSo the next couple questions are going to be on mental and emotional health issues. Have you ever been told by a mental health professional, a doctor, psychiatric nurse that you had a mental or emotional condition? R:\tJust recently. I:\tAnd what did they say? R:\tThey said I was autistic. I had no idea. I:\t[43:44 crosstalk]. R:\tWell, next dooroh gosh, another one of my best friends, but I don't see him enough anymorehe's 89. And he's a world-famous surgeon. He was a Dean at UC, a Dean at UC Davis, at SF. He's a consultant for emergency medicine throughout the entire country. He set up the first trauma center here at SF General. And, you know, he just looked at me and said, you know you're autistic. And I said, you're crazy. [Name], my wife, has a very severe autistic brotheryou know, work-enabled. But she didn't think so, either. But then I have a very old, good friend who is a professor of psychology. And I Skyped him up. I said, do you think I'm autistic? Didn't even blink. Of course you are. So that's the existentialsee, I'm so proud of my brain that, you know, I think it's one of the best in the world, but now I know it's broken. I:\tWould you consider autism as broken? R:\tOh yeah, that's broken. And so many of my past experiences now make so much sense, where people are telling me, don't you see? And, you know, I'm going, what are you talking about? You know, you're crazy. You know, you're just, you know, trying to mix me up. And so I'm sort of in a very introspective moment in my life. You know, to find out at 63 you're autistic when you think you had a perfectly functioning human brainlife's always interesting. I:\tWere those experiences where you're like, oh, maybe I am autistic ... R:\tNo, I mean, I was absolutely sure everybody was wrong. And now, you know, two people I really trustnow I have to come to grips with it, and understand it, and make adjustments. I:\tAnd do you feel like it played a big part in your past goal, even if you didn't know about it? R:\tOh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's one of the reasons why I've been beaten up a lot. I:\tDo you feel like explaining a little bit about that, or R:\tLuckily, in a Jesuit high school, you can't beat up each other. If I went to a normal high school, I would have been the kid shoved in the locker and everything all the time, okay? In grammar school, the nuns didn't have that much of a handle, so, you know, I would be regularly dragged out of the schoolyard and tromped on by both boys and girls in groups, okay? And then, you know, it makes sense now where I'm seeing where people I trusted that I shouldn't have trusted ... I:\tThroughout your life? R:\tThroughout my lifethat's why they walked away with all my money. I:\tAnd do you have an example to [47:26 inaudible]? R:\tWell, I wrote a program called Keynote, which [name]I know those guys from day one, the [name]s, okay? But the guy that said he was going to market it and make so much money did market it and make so much money, but he had me paying for all the advertising at the same time, because I always have a major client. And I wrote the Keynote program practically overnight. And it became extremely popular on the IBM PCs, the first ones. And he pocketed all the money on me. He said it wasn't selling. And then I'm then to multimedia. I already said that. And that's what I formed a little company for. And the patent, which is only in my namethe first multimedia patentwas moved to Canada by [name]. And you could leave that name in, okay? [Name]he's the M in [name]. [Name] was one of the original film companies. And he moved the patent to Canada, so I couldn't get an attorney to get my patent rights back. The patent made over $35 million, and I didn't get a penny, because I trust the wrong people, because I can't see what a normal human being sees. I:\tIn trustworthy people? R:\tIn, you know, communicating with people. So yeah, it's had an effect my whole life. I landed on my feet. I:\tSo coming back to mental and emotional issues, have you ever felt that you had an issue that wasn't diagnosed, that someone didn't say anything about? R:\tNo. I:\tHave you ever thought you had a learning disability or a processing issue? R:\tYeah, what I'm now coming to terms with. I:\tHave you ever taken medication prescribed by a doctor for a mental or emotional issue? R:\tI was supposedly being treated for acne, which you can't see because I keep myself covered up. I also had something in the neighborhood of 40 facial surgeries to close a lot of those scars. But my mother had arranged for the physician to give me Ritalin instead ofand they were hoping that would, you know, make [name] more normal. I:\tAnd how long did you have to take that? R:\tI think it was a month or two, and I said, I really have to stop. Supposedly, it was for my acne. He was, you know, injecting it. And actually, my mom even said, you know, we're going to stop this; your acne isn't getting better. I:\tAnd how old were you at the time? R:\tOh, I must've been about 18, 17, in there. I:\tAnd have you ever been admitted to a mental hospital? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd have you ever received counseling or therapy for a mental or emotional issue? R:\tI tried once, when my father was on his deathbed. I:\tAnd how so? R:\tI went to Kaiser and said, you know, maybe I should talk to, you know, a psychologist. And that didn't work out at all. I:\tNo? R:\tNo. I:\tBecause you didn't get along with R:\tWell, I asked her not to record some stuff, and she did in her notes. And so, you know, when she read her notes back at me on my second session, I just walked out; didn't say a word to her. Just walked out. I:\tBecause you didn't want her to take note of R:\tOf some things, yeah. I:\tSo that was not a helpful experience for you. R:\tNo, not at all. I:\tDo you feel like you have an emotional or mental issue now, aside from the recently-termed autism that you were talking about? R:\tNo. You know, I'm pretty pissed off, but that's not an emotional issue. I think I'm justifiably pissed off. I:\tAnd are you talking about your pretrial diversion situation? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tAnd we'll get to that in a second. R:\tI figured. I:\tAnd how would you say your emotional or mental concerns have changed over the years? R:\tPretty much, I'm happy with me. I mean, I play piano. I compose. I do great work. Yeah. Most people, you know, would like a piece of what I have. I:\tIs there anything more you'd like to add to that topic? R:\tNo, that's fine. I:\tSo the next block is around arrests, and convictions, and those things. Approximately how many times have you been arrested in your lifetime? R:\tOnce. I:\tAnd for what charge was that for? R:\tArrested. I was arrested for two felony arsons, the bail of which was set for $400,000 apiece. I:\tAnd how old were you at this time? R:\t[name], do you remember age? OV:\tSixty? R:\tWas I 60 even? OV:\tYeah. I:\tAnd could you describe for me the events of your arrest? So that day, leading up to it, and R:\tLet's start with leading up to it. Okay, [name] was just convicted. I mean, a person who I think is one of the greatest American patriots of this millennia, okay? And arrested, convicted. I got really pissed and a little drunk, and there's a veteran downstairs. He had American flags in his plant pod outside his house, and I burned one of thema toy flag. And a week later, the police bang on the door, drag me outwell, no, they didn't drag me outside. They wanted to come inside, but I had a very bad feeling, because there were three of them, okay? It's the first time I'm in trouble with the police, but I feel it's not like any other situation I had with the police, okay? You know, up until then, I was a concerned citizen. If something happened, I'd call the police. If something was going on outside, and I observed it, I'd go down and talk to the police on the scene, and give them witness. You know, to me, it was a civic responsibility. And then the police bang on my door, and don't give me time to change or anything. And there was one woman cop that said, you know, they saw you burn the flag. And I said, yeah, I burned a toy flag, you know. I was pissed at the government, you know. You know, when I was in high school, I used to burn an American flag a week in Washington Square Park. I mean, you know, the Vietnam War protest, you knowthis is what you do to show your disfavor with the government and what the government's doing. And the guy downstairs was forcedbecause he was the accuserbut it goes really deeper than this. The guy downstairs, they say, you don't want him arrested for this, do you? And he said, no. Finally, he said, noyou know, this vindictive thug Iraqi war veteran, tiny, itty-bitty brain, okay? Spoke proudly of killing people. I mean, yeah, proudly, like it's an accomplishment to kill someone, okay? So needless to say, we weren't on best of terms. But when I burned the flag, I fell into a trap in the fire department. I:\tHow so? R:\tCivic-minded, remember? When the alarm system started breaking in this place, a fire inspector from the fire department was called in to declare what had to be done. And this fire inspector decided that we had to upgrade our entire system towhat year was it? It was 1990-something, late '90s. No, wait a minute. It was 63 years agoso it was to the 2010 standards. And she said, well, because the company that made your equipment doesn't exist anymore, and you can't replace in kind. I'm an engineer, okay? And I said, well, this sounds like total bullshit, because I know when you make a fire alarm, the parts have got to be available for 50 years. So I went digging, and I found, at the bottom ofI think it was Honeywell or somethingI found the large company that bought the small company that still had to make the devices for the fire alarm system, and I turned a $16-million project that, obviously to me, the fire inspector was getting a piece of, along with Cityscapebecause they get a piece of everythingthe management company for the three buildingsand I called her up, and I said, hey, I found the parts; it's great. She never answered. Went up the chain. I called her boss, her captain. And he happened to be from the next town over in New Jersey, and we got along famously. And I said, all I'm trying to do is save us some money. And he goes, yeah, okay. That makes perfect sense. I'll talk to her. Well, she got fired. So the fire department had it in for me. And even though the guy downstairs dropped charge, and the police left, the police came back when the fire department came down on the police, and said, you have to arrest him. I:\tAnd did you ever find proof that they instigated that, or is this a hunch that you had? R:\tIt's all over the paperwork, you know, because I had to hire a lawyer, and I got all the paperwork. It's all over the paperwork. So mind you, for burning a toy flag, they threw me in solitary for three days from that point on. But before solitary, they wouldn't take me into the prison, because I have hypertensionvery well under control, except at times of great stress. First of all, another thing that got me really pissed off is, when they took me away, they said, you'll be back in an hour. And it was a bold-face lie. I didn't have any idea that the police could look you in the eye and tell you a lie. I mean, I thought the police had to tell the truth when they were arresting you. They didn't even tell me the charge. They didn't even read me my Miranda rightswhich, actually, I think they did that on purpose. I:\tAnd why do you think that? R:\tBecause they didn't want to arrest me. Well, the woman didn't want to arrest me. The two guys wanted to arrest me. I burned a flag. But the lady cop was sort of, you know, this is a personal thing going on here. And it was the fire department that really pissed her off, and then she didn't read the MirandaI'm sure that's why she didn't read the Mirandas, because, you know, that's a rookie mistake, you know. I:\tAnd was that something you were able to use later on in the process? R:\tOh yeah. I'll finish the whole story. I:\tYeah, continue, please. R:\tSo they put me in holding here at Richmond. I thought the next thing was going to happen. I was going to go home. They came in. They then took me towhat is it calledthe building of non-justice. I:\tThe CJCis that it? R:\tIs that it? Where the jail is. I:\tOkay, so that's 850 Bryant. R:\tYeah, they took me there. And they tried to push me right into the jail. They took my blood pressure. And I was already not feeling well. I was not feeling well at all. When I was in the holding cell, the walls were melting, okay? And I knew that the ringing in my ears meant that my blood pressure was at a lifetime high. And they wouldn't put me in the jail; they sent me to San Francisco General, in order to get my blood pressure down. At San Francisco General, I spent, you know, a good number of hours there. They wanted to give me psychoactives to calm me down, but I never demonstrated any, you know, aggressive behavior or anything like that; I was just sick. And I'm pretty sure at that point, I had a stroke, a small strokesomething that, you know, debilitated me quite a bit. So they take me. They gave me, you know, my normal stuffverapamil and lisinopril, and I think they gave me some HCT. And they got it down, you know, at least where I wasn't going to stroke out any moment. And they took me back to the jail. They put me into solitary for three days. I:\tAnd this was at 850 Bryant? R:\tYeah. Three days of general, then they put me in the general population for another two days. And then in that time, two policeare there police inspectors in San Francisco or detectives? I:\tDetectives. R:\tSo two lady detectives come to the jail, read me my Miranda rights, ask me a few questions. I say, I don't have a lawyer; I can't talk to you. I really can't. And they say, thoroughly understand. And that night, one of the guards passed by and says, you're out. And the next day, they released me, and instead of having an $800,000 two felony account against me, they reduced it towhat's the least kind of vandalism? I:\tIt's just a misdemeanor, like [01:05:22 inaudible]. R:\tYeah, I mean nothing, you know. I:\tSo were you given access to a counsel at any time, or did you not want a counsel? R:\tI kept onmy wife went crazy. I mean, we were trying to find counsel. One loser showed up that wasyou know, he was sweating profuselylawyer. Then a public defender came, and I asked for release on my own recognizance. I mean, because this is, you know, just total ridiculous. And finally, without counsel, they lowered the charge from double felony to, you know, minor misdemeanor. I:\tAnd you found that out at the point of your release? R:\tAt the moment of my release from the jail. That's when I found out. I didn't find out that I was charged with two felonies until I was inside the solitary. I:\tAnd how long afterfrom arrest to finding that outhow much time passed? R:\tThe felony? I:\tFinding out that you had two felonies. R:\tIt was the next day in jail, in solitary. Oh, wait a minute. No, they didn't give me the paperwork until they released me in the general population. That's when I found out I had two felonies. I:\tSo you had three days in solitary where you had no idea. OV:\tI hate to interrupt, but that's not correct, because I called for a bail bondsman, and then they told me that it was $800,000two $400,000 felony convictions. R:\tBut I did not know that. OV:\tYes, I told you that, because we were talking to each other every couple of hours on the phone. You don't remember. R:\tI don't, because OV:\tYeah, I know. It's traumatic. I understand. R:\tIt was the most horrific experience of my life. It made me lose faith in everything in the United States and community. I mean, I worked for the people in this place when the internet went down in the '90s. I created a small company just to provide the people in these three buildings with internet. And I only charged them $30 each. I mean, I did the thing with the fire alarm where we were going to get a $24-million charge, and I turned it down to a $6-million charge. And then these people viciously turn on me. And it wasn't only the guy downstairs. I burnt an American flag. They're all suddenly all flag-waving hallucinogenics, you know. I:\tAre you talking about your other neighbors? R:\tYeah. I mean, you know, people we were inside their houses anytime they needed their computers fixed for free, for that $30 a month, we went into their houses. We fixed their computers for free, for the $30 a month for the charge, you know. And you couldn't get internet out here, you know. I told you, you know, I've been on the internet since the '70s, and they knew it, and they had me do it for them. For 10 years, we ran a perfect business. And then we get home. I am severely suffering from PTSD. My brain's not working. As I said, I think I had a stroke. I asked for checkups at Kaiser. Kaiser wasn't interested in, you know, going completely over me. I:\tThis is post getting out that you're talking about? R:\tPost getting out. And yeah, it's devastating. It was just totally devastating that, you know, the police department, the fire department, the people in the complexhow they turned on a dime. I:\tDo you still feel that way now? R:\tOh, absolutely. I:\tDo you feel like this is a safe place for you to live? R:\tSafe, yes. I:\tBut you feel antagonism from R:\tI feel anger towards them. And one thing I've learned is, you don't give people a second chance. I:\tAnd that's from your past experiences? R:\tThat's from all of my business experiences. Yeah, and the few people that really wanted a second chance that I gave a second chance to, and they just did the same thing all over again. I:\tSo going back to the time of the arrestat that point, did you feel like the police were treating you fairly? R:\tNo. They lied. I:\tSo they told you that you were going to be detained for an hour? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd R:\tIt turned into five days, three of which were in solitary confinement. I:\tAnd so, for my clarification, they came to your home. R:\tYeah. I:\tThey asked you, and then they left, and then they came back again. R:\tYep. I:\tAnd how much time passed in between those two R:\tLess than an hour. I:\tAnd so they took you from your home to a police station. R:\tMm-hmm [yes]the Richmond police station. I:\tThen they took you to 850 Bryant. R:\tAnd 850 Bryant would not let me in because of my blood pressure. I:\tAnd then you went to SF General. R:\tAnd then back to Bryant. I:\tAnd how long did you spend at SF General? R:\tAt least five hours. I:\tGeneralizations work. Have you ever been convicted of a crime? R:\tNo. Then we hired this do-nothing lawyer for $5,000. She showed up once. And she didn't even show up when I had fulfilled the requirements for the diversion program. She didn't even show up. She just let the judge decide that he did it. I:\tThe private attorney? R:\tYeah. I never did like lawyers. You could guess why. I:\tSo have you ever spent time in juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tHow about a prison? R:\tThat was it. I don't think that's prison, though. You call that one jail. Right. I learned the difference between those through this experience. I thought they were all jail and prison and interchangeable, you know. I:\tHave you ever spent time on parole or probation? R:\tNo, they didn't give me any parole. I:\tAnd it was just the one time that you spent in the jail, and that was about five days? R:\tYeah. I got to say, I mean, when they put me in the general population, I think they cherry-picked. You know, they put me with, you know, nice guys. I mean, you know, yeah, nobody ever threatened me or anything like that. I:\tAnd were you in a cell block, or one just giant cell? R:\tWhat's the difference? I:\tA cell block is, you have individual cells along the side, and you have a clear space in the middle. R:\tThis was a weird one. They have this one cell right next tothe cell block car door. You have these on both sides. But then you go all the way to the end, to the pigpen. And next to the pigpen, there's a room maybe twice the size of this room, with, I'd say, roughly 20 beds in it. I:\tSo kind of like a hostel, in the way that the beds are set up on the wall. R:\tThey're bunk bedsmaybe 10 different bunk bedsand a shower, and a toilet. I learned how to shit and press the button immediately. I:\tSo you were staying in the cell next to what you termed the pigpen? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd the pigpen is, for my R:\tWhere the guards live. And they had direct view into the cell at all times. So I don't know if that was good or bad. I have no experience. I know nobody hassled me. And in fact, you know, there were a couple that actually were very supportive to me. And I think it's because the first time I took a shower, you have that paper that you're supposed to carry around with you, with your charges and everything, and I think they're all very impressed that my bail was $800,000. I:\tSo that was a reputation ... R:\tI think that gave meand I'm an old, fat guy, you know. I think it took me up a couple of ranks. That's complete supposition on my part, because they were kind of surly before I took my first shower. You know, I didn't take the paperwork into the shower, but I left it under my pillow. But suddenly, I got out of the shower, and they're all, oh mano. I:\tSo can you describe these people that were supporting you? R:\tMostly Hispanics. Mostly, you know, immigrants. Yeah, obviously, you know, some of them did some things wrong, but, you know, nothing on the order of, you knowif we were in Norway, or if we were in any civilized country, they wouldn't have been in jail. I:\tAnd you would characterize America as uncivilized? R:\tOh, extremely. Did you read the article today in the paper? I mean, a traffic warrant, and they blow her away inside of her own house, and wing her kid. I:\tWhat happened? R:\tOh, you didn't hear this one? I:\tNo, no. R:\tAnd you know what the article was about? It's unfair that people take pictures of the police killing them. She was posting videos of the police, you knowI mean, SWAT teaming her house over a parking ticket or maybe a traffic violation that she hadn't paid. And they didn't break in. The landlord gave them the key, and they came in, and she had a shotgun. And she was telling them, keep out, keep out, keep out. What kind of country allows the police to escalate a traffic ticket to that degree? No, this is not a civilized country. We have a death penalty. I mean, who has death penalties? Saudi Arabia? India and Pakistan, it's a death penalty to be a girl. But we have that now. I mean, you know, they're suggesting that women who have abortions should be punished. I mean, you think this place is civilized? Yeah, no, it's not a civilized place. I:\tSo the next couple of statements are the strongly agree to strongly disagree again. And they're going to be about legal authorities. \"I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.\" R:\tAbsolutely not. I:\t\"People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.\" R:\tAbsolutely not. I:\t\"It is difficult to break the law and keep one's self-respect.\" R:\tI think you're keeping your self-respect by breaking the law. I:\t\"The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the people like me.\" R:\tThat's absolutely true. I:\t\"People in power use the law to try to control people like me.\" R:\tYes. I:\t\"The law does not protect my interests.\" R:\tAbsolutely not. You know, and it's not only this thing that happened to me; it hasn't protected my interests at all in my whole career. I mean, you know, that's why I went strictly instead of making deals where I get pieces of the action of my product, I make deals where I just get paid by the hour, because ... I:\tAnd are you referencing situations like the patent moving to Canada? R:\tYeah, and stuff like that, yeah. They'll have a thousand different ways of screwing you over. I:\t\"Most police in my city do their job well.\" R:\tNo. I:\t\"Most police in my city treat people with respect.\" R:\tAbsolutely not. I:\t\"Basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police.\" R:\tNot at all. I:\t\"The police in my city have too much power.\" R:\tAbsolutely true. I:\t\"Most police in my city treat some people better than others.\" R:\tYeah, they always treat Mayor Whatshisname really nice. I:\tThe Mayor of ... R:\tOf San Francisco. Yeah, I think he gets treated really well. I:\tBy R:\tPolice. I:\tI can't think of an example for that. R:\tMe either, but that's okay. I mean, you get the idea. Oh, yeah, I know who they treat very well. I:\tWho? R:\t[name] and [name]. I:\tWhy do you say that? R:\tBecause they own the town. I:\tAnd you're referencing San Francisco. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo have you ever felt unfairly treated, stopped, questioned, or searched by the police? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd about how many times in your lifetime would you say this has happened? R:\tOnce in Palo Alto over a traffic ticket. I was pulled over because I forgot a traffic ticket. And I was strip-searched on that for a traffic ticket in Palo Alto. But Palo Alto's famous for that back then, okay? This was way back. Up until thenand then in San Francisco, you know, we had this incident, and then I stopped at a stop sign, and I went, and [name] decided to pull me over, and tell me I ran the stop sign. And I didn't. I just plain didn't. But his quota's whatever. I was in the park. There's no way I can not know where all the stop signs are in the park. And yeah, I called up, and I said, this is wrong. I have to fight this. I spoke to either a lieutenant or a captain. And he says, forget it, you know. Just take the course, because even if you contest it, he won't show up. This guy's known to do this kind of stuff. So he just won't show up, so you can contest the ticket. He said, you'd be wasting your time. I:\tAnd were there other circumstances ... R:\tNo, that's it. I'm very clean-nosed. You know, when I get a speeding ticket, which hasn't been in a very longthe last time I got a speeding ticket was in Santa Rosa, and I deserved a speeding ticket. It was a CHP, and I was on a back road, trying to get around the traffic on 101. And, yeah, I really was going 60 miles an hour in a 50-mile-an-hour zone, no question about it. Yeah, he's an asshole, but, you know I:\tBut it was a fair stop? R:\tI didn't say fair; I said it was legal. He wasn't lying, okay? I:\tAnd what defines fair for you? R:\tOkay, I'll tell you one good incident with the police that was fair. Have you ever been to the Maytag Festival here? I:\tI have not. R:\tOh, it's really gorgeous. They're really good neighbors. They don't shut off the whole park. And they have a free music festival here. OV:\t[01:23:00 inaudible]. R:\tHardly Strictly Bluegrass, it's called, but they have a lot more than just bluegrass music. And I looked around. There are two cops on the picnic table next to me, and they start laughing. So yeah, I was treated fairly. I got to be honest. Yeah. I:\tAnd when was the last time you felt unfairly treated? This circumstance? R:\tYeah. Now, you know, if I see anybody in authority, I cross the street. I don't make eye contact. I do everything I can to avoid them. I:\tAnd is that because of the last experience that you've had? R:\tYeah, mm-hmm. I:\tAnd to what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experiences with police? R:\tOh, my personal race, not at all. But I've seen them take down black people and brown people. I mean, I've seen them disrespect people, yeah. I:\tDo you see that often here? R:\tI see it on the TV, okay? I got to say that, you know. Maybe I've witnessed one arrest of another person in my whole life, but I can't even be sure about that, you know. What I do is, I read about it, and I see it. And I don't watch the videos. What I do is, I read about the videos. I:\tFrom news sources? R:\tYeah, usually the newspaper. Should we turn on that light? I:\tYeah, sure. So going back to the five days at 850 Bryant, could you tell me about the typical day in solitary? R:\tMeal gets pushed through the door. I was let out once to have a shower. I asked for a book, and they laughed at me. And essentially, I just judged the jailers as vicious, mean people. I:\tJailers are law enforcement? Is that what you're talking about? R:\tWell, law enforcement's different than the guys that live in the jail, aren't theythe guards in the jail, right? The lock keys, whatever you call them. I:\tAnd you felt they were R:\tVicious. I:\tAnd what was a typical day like when you were outside of that, when you were in that cell next to the pen? R:\tOnce I got my status bars, you know, the inmates were all very nice. And the guards were still complete, utter assholes. I:\tAnd was there a specific instance where they were R:\tYou know, they don't talk to you. I mean, there should be at least, you know, some sort of briefing that, you know, this is what's going to happen to you, you know, some sort of briefing. And, you know, I mean, I was told I was going to be let go, but only at 2:00 in the morning. And they just sort of whispered it as if he wasn't really talking to me. That was vicious. That was mean. I:\tAnd that was the very last day? R:\tThat was the last night, yeah. I:\tAnd at 2:00 am, this guy walked by and whispered, you're getting released? R:\tYou're getting out, is what he said. I:\tAnd how long after he said that did you actually get out? R:\t7:00 pm the next day. No, it was more like 9:00 pm the next day, yeah. And no other information besides that; just, they showed up in the cell. They showed up outside our cell, rattled off, you know, some names, chained us all together, put us down the elevator, and then had us just wait. Didn't let us use phones or anything. You know, I couldn't call home and say, I'm on my way home. I couldn't get a taxi, because the taxis downtown won't stop for a guy in shorts inappropriately at night. So I had to take buses. The bus broke down. I mean, you know, it was ... I:\tHow long did it take you to get home? R:\tAt least two, three hours. I:\tAnd what was the biggest challenge while you were inside? R:\tKeeping my hope. I:\tThat you were going to get released? R:\tYeah, because I knew the charge was total bullshit. I mean, this is the kind of thing that, you know, somebody burns down an apartment building, and 12 people die. That's the kind of charge they hit me withand two of them, as if I burnt down two apartment buildings. I:\tAnd you said that you and your wife were able to have phone conversations during that time? R:\tOnce I got into the general population, yeah. I:\tSo while you were in solitary, you had no phone? R:\tI think I got one call a day. OV:\tYes, you did, dear. R:\tI got one call a day. I:\tAnd were you able to access counsel in solitary? R:\tYeah. As I said, the public defender came, and the sweaty lawyer to be interviewed. I wouldn't let him near my case. I:\tAnd that was a private attorney, though? R:\tThat was a private attorney. I:\tThe sweaty guy? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd then you picked up another private attorney R:\tOnce I was out. And she turned out to be, yeah, only in it for the money. It's pretty obvious. I mean, you know, because the association called me downstairs to try me again. And they didn't even ask me what the charges were or anything. You know, I didn't even know what the charges were. And they changed the rules especially for me, so that the first $150 fine was boosted to $2,000. The HOA fined me $2,000. But, you know, these were all the people that were my best friends that, you know, I gave internet to for 10 years and everything. They railroaded me. I:\tHOA is the housing association [01:30:46 crosstalk]? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tAnd while you were at 850 Bryant, were there any informal rules or unwritten behaviors that you had to adhere to? R:\tOh, there was one that I didn't know. The first thing I do, I get up in the morning; I take a shower. And that was a bad thing to do. You know, they just said, don't do that again. I:\tSo you're not allowed to take showers in the morning? R:\tBecause of the inspections of the cells. There's one guy that was an absolute cleaning fanatic. And he would clean everything up. And I didn't realize that, you know, I shouldn't get up in the morning and take a shower. I had to wait until everybody told me to take a shower. In fact, that is what, you know, pretty much saved me at that pointwhen I realized, you know, I don't do anything without their permission. I:\tAnd you're talking about your fellow cellmates at that point? R:\tYeah, yeah, the cellmates, yeah. I:\tAnd did you have any responsibilities or obligations on the outside that you were not able to fulfill? R:\tNo, I squeaked by on that. I can't remember if I was between jobs or if I was doing a job. OV:\tYou were between. R:\tI was between jobs, so I lucked out there. I:\tAnd did you have any family obligations you couldn't make, or ... R:\tNo. It was only five days. I mean, I get to see my family, as I said, you know, once a year. I:\tAnd did you have any responsibilities on the inside that you had to take care ofchores, things they would tell you to do? R:\tNo, they never asked me to do anything. I:\tAnd were you offered any services or programs during your stay? These would be related to health, or housing [01:33:00 crosstalk]. R:\tThey never gave me my right doses of medicine. I:\tThey never did? R:\tNo, I never got my full blood pressure medication regime ever, in all of the five days. By the time I came out, my blood pressure was so crazy that, you know, it took me a week to recover. I:\tAnd how much were they cutting your dosage? R:\tLess than half. I:\tFor five days? R:\tFor five days. I:\tAnd so I definitely assume they were not offering you any health services or programs. R:\tThey brought me down to the nurse once, when I said, I'm not feeling well in the solitary. And she said, you know, I can't give you pills. I said, let my wife bring the pills. And they said, we can't do that. And she said, I don't have your pills. She said, drink water. Drink lots and lots of waterwhich is basically good advice for, yeah, untreated hypertension. I:\tWere there any things that were offered to you in terms of housing, or employment, ordid they ask you questions about that at all? R:\tNot at all. I did have an internment entrance interview. And I said, you know, I'm pretty much a political prisoner here. I'm in here for burning an American flag with an unjust charge. And I said, you know, maybe I should do aI told her, you know, what do you think would help my caseif I went on a hunger strike? And she said, don't do that. I:\tSo you got advice from someone R:\tFrom one person, you know, who was the first person to interview me when I came in. Oh, and I did get advice from the cops that took me from the Richmondnot the arresting officers, but the cops that took me from the Richmond to Bryant. In fact, they were the ones stuck with me in general. One of them was actually really fascinated by my work, and he wouldn't stop talking about it, because I was explaining to him that I quit working for [name] when they asked me to work on the Apache helicopter cannonthat they wanted it aimed with the eyes of the pilotbecause he was obviously military. And, you know, he knew about that system. And I said, yeah, well, it doesn't work as well as it could have. I don't work on weapons systems. So yeah, they said, don't tell anybody you burnt a flag. I:\tAnd that was the advice the cops gave you? R:\tYes. He said, don't tell anybody you burnt a flag. And I said, what? And they said, don't do it. I:\tDid they tell you what might happen, or did they just give you the advice? R:\tI said, what? Why? And I think the retort to that was, some of those people in there really love the flag. I mean, I lost all respect for the flag in 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated with obvious help from the government, you know. I was 10 years old. You know, I wasn't stupid, you know. It seemed like America took a stupid pill on that day. I:\tSo were there any services, aside from having your medication, that you would have liked to have had while you were there? R:\tNo. I just wanted out. A door would have been very nice. I:\tSo did your family outside your wife know what had happened? R:\tWe haven't told anyone. It stays between [name] and I. I:\tAnd how important were visits, and phone calls, and connections? R:\tThey were horrible. I mean, you know, they had to happen, but they were extremely stressful for both of us. I:\tBecause you didn't know what was going on? R:\tRightbecause neither one of us had any experience along these lines. There was no briefing. There was no outreach to her, where there should have been. I mean, that's a very serious crime, as she found out when she started calling lawyers the next day. I mean, you know, there should have been outreach. I:\tAnd when did your wife find out? R:\tShe was here when they took me away. Yeah, we live together. I:\tWell, I didn't know if she was away, and you had been taken when she did not know. R:\tNo, no, no. I:\tAnd you said one phone call a day for solitary. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd were those to your wife? R:\tYeah. OV:\tNo. If I may interject, there were more than one. R:\tOnce I got out of solitary. OV:\tOh no, even then, there was more than one. R:\tReally? OV:\tBecause that's why I set up the lawyers for you to see and all that. And I might add a little bit that it's very expensive for those calls, and we obviously have assets, but I think the average person ... R:\tWouldn't have the assets to keep up the phone calls. Those phones should be free. I:\tHow much time were you given on the phones? R:\tI don't remember being thrown off. I:\tSo you were able to make your phone call without being told to R:\tStop. Yeah, I don't think so. I:\tAnd while you were detained, did any of these things make it difficult to contact your family? R:\tMy wife was denied visitation. I:\tAnd why was that? Were you told? R:\tDenied. I:\tJust denied? They didn't give a reason? R:\tNo, denied. OV:\tNo, I wasn't allowed to go with him. They said, no, no, no, no. R:\tThat's all they said. OV:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I offered to bring his medication. No, absolutely not. You stay right here, lady. R:\tWell, what do you mean lack of transportation in this? I:\tLack of transportation for your family. R:\tOh, no. That's about it. I mean, there's no way in hell my family members were ever going to find out about it. I:\tAnd you're talking about your family in New Jersey? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd did you ever tell your daughter [01:40:47 inaudible]? R:\tNope. I:\tDo you feel like your experiences affected your relationship at all with her? R:\tNope. I:\tAnd you were eventually released before a decision on your case was made, right? R:\tYep. Well, I mean, if you call the decision dropping the two felony charges to a misdemeanor, a class B misdemeanor, that's a pretty big decision, isn't it? I mean, suddenly, they wanted $800,000. And I got from there to the point where, we should not have arrested you, should we have? I:\tAnd do you remember what conditions you were released under? So personal recognizance, bail? R:\tYeah, they have an alphabet soup for it. I:\tConditional release, supervised R:\tThat one, the second one. But I shouldn't have been in jail with what they charged me with before I left the jail. I:\tAnd was there any bail that was set for you? R:\tEight hundred thousand dollars. I:\tDid you pay any of that at any time? R:\tNo. I mean, we would have had to, you know, burglarize our entire retirement accounts. It was ridiculous, because they didn't have a leg to stand on. I mean, you know, I did not commit two felonies, and I just had to wait it out. I:\tAnd with the misdemeanor, did they fine you or anything? R:\tNope. In fact, they said they buried it, that nobody could find it. And I think that's more for their own, because, you know, if anybody could find it, I probably would have wound up suing the city. I:\tThe two felonies or the record of them? R:\tNo, the record of the misdemeanor. I'm pretty sure the record of the felonies have totally disappeared. At least, I'm assured they have. I:\tSo could you tell me about the process of being released? So you said that the guy came by your cell. R:\tWhispered it. I:\tSo how were you released? Did they transfer you somewhere else? R:\tNo, it was still in Bryant. I was on, you know, one of the upper floors. Some guy came; called off our names; told us to take our mattresses and personal effects, which, with mine, was the badge of honor. I:\tPiece of paper? R:\tYeah. And walked out of the cell. And then I guess that was around noon. You don't have a watch, and you can't see a clock. I:\tThere's no clock? R:\tThere's no clock; at least one that you could see, you know. So you know, I know by the time I got out of there, it was nighttime. And it was impossible to get transportation. What they told me was, the little wristband will get you on any bus for free. I:\tAnd the wristband was given to you by the jail? R:\tYes, the wristband you get when you first come in. I:\tAnd that stays on you the entire time? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd were you given any advice on your way out? R:\tNope. I:\tDid you have any personal effects that you were given back? R:\tActually, I came out ahead. I:\tHow so? R:\tThey took me away in my stocking feet, and they gave me a pair of flip-flops when I left. But I had nothing in my pockets. I:\tSo you weren't ... R:\tWhich was actually a benefit, because if you have nothing in your personal effects, they don't dock you anything, and you get a certain minimum amount of stuff. So that was an interesting thing. I forgot all about this until you mentioned that. I would order for the other guys whatever they wanted. I:\tOrder what? R:\tEvery day, they came around with a sheet and what you wanted that day, and you were allowed so many items. I:\tFrom your own personal effects? R:\tFor your own personal use, like shampoo, and different types of food. You know, they only eat processed meat. I wouldn't eat any of the processed meat. So I gave my fellow inmates the processed meat, and I would eat the bread, which was good. I lost a few pounds. I:\tAnd so you would get things for the other guys that were with you? R:\tYeah, yeah, just whatever they wanted. I'd check it for them. But that only happened twice, because, you know, I was only in general population for two days. You don't get that when you're in solitary. I:\tYou don't get any time with R:\tYou don't get the sheet that says what you want. I:\tAre you given anything at all? R:\tNothing. I asked for a book. I:\tAnd they denied you a book? R:\tYeah. I:\tDid you have any ... R:\tAnd he laughed. I:\tHe laughed at the fact that you asked for a book? R:\tYes. I:\tSo could you tell me about any concerns that you had as you were being released, or did you have any? R:\tI was high as a kite at that point. I:\tYou were just happy? R:\tEnmorphins? OV:\tEndorphins. R:\tEndorphins, yeah. I was flying on endorphins at that point. I was going to write a book. I was going to change the whole system. Then I woke up the next day and said, no, no. I:\tSo of these negative consequences, did you experience any of these? R:\tI couldn't work for a year. So which one of these is this? Because it's not that I lost my job, because I always had my job. I:\tI'll put that in other. And could you explain to me why? R:\tI was suffering extreme, severe PTSD. I:\tAnd was that from a specific instance within your experience, or was it the entire ... R:\tThe whole experience, yeah. You know, I'm very delicatetruly. I mean, I've never been through anything like that. And yeah, it bent me. It bent me for almost a solid year. I:\tAnd was there something that was particularly traumatic about ... R:\tThe whole unfairness. I:\tOf being ... R:\tRailroaded by my community, my immediate community that I've done so much for, and the fire department, and the police department. You know, I feel, you know, I don't want any part of it. You know, we're looking into moving to Europe. It's at least civilized there. I:\tYeah, you mentioned Norway before. R:\tOh, no, Italy. I:\tWarm and R:\tYeah. I:\tSo was your experience in detention any different from what you thought it would be prior to that? R:\tI never thought of being in detention before. I:\tYou had no preconception as to what it might be like? R:\tNo, absolutely not, because I'm a straight arrow. I mean, you know, I even stopped smoking marijuana years ago, you know. I mean, I had a brush with certain early members of the computer community that ... I was participating in what we call black hat activities in the late '70s. And one of our group was arrested by the federal police. And he was placed in prison, federal prison. And he got free healthcare. They gave him ECS three times a week. I:\tAnd what is that? R:\tElectroconvulsive shock. And by the time he came out, his brain was fried. I:\tAnd R:\tBut it was therapy. I:\tThat was court-ordered for him? R:\tIt had to be. I mean, you know, he wouldn't ask for it. I:\tAnd was this person close to you at the time? R:\tWe were very close. Together, we wrote the first word processor for the IBM PC. I:\tAnd can you describe, for my understanding, a black hat situation, just an example, maybe? R:\tThe device we built enabled my friend, my coworker, to dial Richard Nixon on the CIA hotline and ask for more toilet paper for the CIA. Is that black hat enough for you? I:\tYes, that is. R:\tAnd they got him, and they destroyed his brain. And from that point onI mean, I did the normal stuff that kids did. You know, we hooked up the elevators in the computer science building so anybody that we didn't like got a ride. I:\tGot an infinite ride on the elevator? R:\tPretty much. I mean, you know, we used to have games where we used to walk pieces of computer equipment across the room by writing programs that'll find the fundamental frequency of them. I:\tThat's fascinating. R:\tWell, yeah, you do that stuff, but then you find out that, you know, the federal government frowns on that a lot. And ever since then, I've been straight as an arrow in everything. I've done work for [name], and, you know, I did a lot of work for [name] in getting medical information out of what they call the Desert Theater to the hospitals in Frankfurt, and San Antonio, and Maryland, in order to save the lives of the brain-dead guys that were coming out of there, you knowwhich, you know, makes me feel even more betrayed, because, you know, I worked really hard for these son of a bitches. I:\tAnd the black hat situationhow old were you at the time? R:\t20s. I:\tAnd these are mostly experiences in your 20s, you would say? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd going back to the detentiondid you feel like you were changed in a way? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd was there anything good that came out of it? R:\tNothing. I:\tAnd the biggest way you were changed was R:\tComplete distress in the American system. I:\tAnd is there anything more you would like to add to that topic? R:\tI think we pretty much covered it. I:\tAnd you participated in a diversion program, or ... R:\tYeah. That's another thing that pissed me off about the lawyer. She wanted to start moving it into court. And I read the transcripts. And the judge looked at her and said, I really think we should put this in the diversion program. And she said, well, okaybecause I'm sure she thought she would have gotten more money out of us if, you know, we didn't go into diversion. But diversion cost me money, because I had to hire a psychologist, and I had to go to a psychologist some number of times. And I got a certificate that I'm all better. I:\tAnd how were you first informed about pretrial diversion as an option? Do you remember? R:\tPossibly that very same attorney, yeah. I:\tIt was brought up as R:\tAs one of my legal choices. I:\tAnd do you feel like she helped you make a decision, or R:\tNo, she was a total raving bitch that was only in it for the money. I:\tSo an interview is often conducted at the very beginning of pretrial for eligibility. Do you remember that occurring? R:\tYeah, I went down. They have an office around the corner from Bryant. And this black woman just wanted to hug me. I remember that now. I:\t[01:54:16 crosstalk]? R:\tYeah. You could see it in heryou poor SOB, you know. She just said, you're not going to be any trouble for anybody. She didn't go as far as saying it was just horseshit, but the empathy I felt from her, even in my autistic condition. I:\tAnd did she ask you questions about R:\tWho I was, what I did, you know. She already had my whole record, which was blank. I:\tAnd would you say that the diversion staff treated you well? R:\tYes, very well. In fact, it was really nice, because they allowed me to attend a group that halved the number of paid sessions I had to go to, to the private psychologist. They had a sort of group thing that qualified for the psychological element. And then I had to pay the guy downstairs $2.50 for his flag. And then I had to pay the association $80 to clean up the smoke spots that I did not put on the wall, but they said I did. I:\tFrom the same incident? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd so you had to pay those fees for those R:\tTo end theand then that whole thing got packaged up, sent to the judge. The lawyer didn't even bother to show up. The judge just said, okay, this never happened. We shall not talk about this again. I think he was Klingon. I:\tAnd were you ever aware of a level of risk that was assigned to you? R:\tHuh? I:\tSo offenders can be labeled low risk, medium risk, high risk. Were you ever aware of any of those labels being assigned to you? R:\tNo, and I would think that low risk was a little too high for me. I:\tAnd were you ever aware of a needs assessment? So something where they ask you about ... R:\tI mean, you know, I told them immediately, I could afford anything you could throw at me, you know. I:\tAnd at the beginning of the program, how much did you feel like it would reduce your odds of reoffending? R:\tWill I ever burn an American flag again? Not unless I'm not in America. I:\tSo you're optimistic about the program, or R:\tWhen I get to Italy, if there's a flag-burning, count on me. I:\tSo those feelings didn't come from the program, though. R:\tHmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm [no]. I:\tAnd do you feel like race or ethnicity played a part in any of your diversion experience? R:\tI think the guys in the cell thought I was Hispanic, because when I first got there, they started all speaking Spanish to me. I don't think I had as much of a beard, either. I had something of a beard. Yeah. They knew I wasn't white, to California standard. I:\tAnd do you remember which diversion program you participated in? R:\tMaybe it was Project 22? No, no, I don't remember any. It definitely wasn't Neighborhood Court; wasn't Involvement Team. That's what I was originally released upon. Oh, pretrial diversionthat's it. They could put the spacing a little better on those. I:\tOn the wording? R:\t[01:58:56 inaudible] get the right button. It's not as if they're taking up the whole page for these things. I:\tAnd how much did it cost you to participate in diversion? Do you remember? R:\tI think the whole total was $2,500 for the private psychologist, and then it was $85 in restitution. I think they had a fee tacked on, but I don't remember what it was. It was not any onerous fee; at least, you know, I didn't think it was an onerous fee. I:\tAnd the conditions of your participation were R:\tThat I go to a psychologist, make restitution, and show up once a week at their office. I think that's the whole thing. And I had the whole thing done in a month. I:\tDo you remember how many sessions you had to attend, or R:\tA dozen, maybe. Yeah. I:\tAnd were there any special conditions to your participation that you remember? R:\tNope. I:\tAnd you said one month, it took you? R:\tYeah. I was done with their requirements in about a month. I:\tAnd did the program do anything to address your needs? R:\tYeah, it got me out of having a record of any sort. So you know, that was my major concern. You know, I didn't want anybody to be able to, you know, write a letter and ask, you know, if I was ever arrested. And supposedly, that doesn't happen. I think the only way the arrest can be recorded is from law enforcement agency to law enforcement agency. I don't think anybody on the outside could look at it. At least, that's what the lawyer told me, but she was a worthless bitch anyway. I:\tDo you feel like you got any benefits from participation, in personal relationships, education? R:\tI mean, most of the benefits are negative. I:\tIn what way? R:\tAbsolutely knowing that, you know, I cannot rely on my government or my community for anythingmy immediate community here. That's a benefit. So yeah, I know that, you know, I'll never let them take advantage of me again. I:\tWas there anything about your program that you felt was particularly helpful for you? R:\tNo. I'll reiterate the thing that I said before: There's no record. I:\tAnd that was R:\tThat's the only benefit I can think of that is out of the system. You know, the psychological benefit is, you know, I have zero trust. And that, I deem as a benefit at this point. I:\tAnd the negative consequences were R:\tWell, apparently, you know, there aren't any. I mean, my old clients are still calling me. I got a new client, and it's, you know, a particularly, you know, large organization that checks out everybody that works for them, a very paranoid organization. I didn't get anything about, you knownone of the military came for the door, you know, becauseI didn't have clearance, but I did work on secret programs. And, you know, there was no spit back on that. So I'm pretty sure that, you know, it got as buried as it can get in our open society. Actually, what do they call it? The surveillance society. It's as closed-mouth as it possibly can. I don't think it's affected me getting more business. As I said, you know, I couldn't work for a year because of, you know, the PTSD. So I already took off my year from my decade herenot intentionally. I:\tSo were you with other program participants, or R:\tIn the group therapy thing. It was very scary. I:\tWhy do you say that? R:\tPeople I would never, ever associate with. I:\tDescribe them for me. R:\tStupid, bigoted, uneducated, angry. I mean, angry for no real reason. That was scary. That was in the group therapy group. So I did the minimum number of those, just to make sure, you know. I:\tWere there any participants that you got along with? R:\tNope. It was like my high school; I don't want to see anybody. I:\tAnd could you tell me about the staff that you interacted with? R:\tThe staff there were allyou know, perhaps I was a breath of fresh air to me, because, you know, they knew I wasn't supposed to be there, you knowat least I still have that kind of thought process about meis that, you know, the whole thing was, you know, a scam, a setup. You know, in my mind, I think they alland they, too, told me, don't say you burned a flag. I:\tYeah, continuing advice. R:\tYeah. I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tNo. Yeah, I didn't like how much money it took out of my wallet, especially for that psychologist, you know. I:\tYeah, but that was something that you were able to set up privately. That was your ... R:\tThat was my choice. I could have, you know, gone throughbut that would have taken three months. And instead, I wanted it done in a month. You know, I wanted to get thisand I think that's why, you know, the judge wiped it immediately. He didn't ask to see me. I was never before a judge. I:\tAfter your release ... R:\tAt any time in the whole process. I was never in a courtroom. I:\tSo it was just communication between you and your attorney? R:\tRight. I:\tAnd pretrial diversion. R:\tRight. And I got a copy of the entire record. And what I know of my neighbors now justyeah. It's all in the emails, because they submitted emails. I:\tAnd were you ever accused of violating the program? R:\tNo. I think that would have been impossible. I:\tAnd how did it end? So you got your certificate. R:\tGot my certificate from the private psychologist. When I went to the last group, and I announced, I'm a graduate, you know, the guy there said, you know, you could come back anytime you want. Yeah, bud. Yeah, I will. Did I say the people there were toxic, too? I:\tNo, you did not. R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tAnd you're talking about the participants? R:\tThe participants were pretty toxic, not the staff. The staffI don't know how they do that kind of job. I really have no idea. I'm not a people person. I:\tSo you were given the certificate. You didn't have to go to court again. R:\tNever went to court. I:\tWas there a graduation thing, or any other documentation for the termination of the program? R:\tNo. They just sent me a paper saying, you did everything in the maila receipt. I:\tAnd to what extent do you agree with the following statement? \"Overall, the program was very helpful.\" R:\tFor me, yeah. I:\tAnd you say that, as I've heard, because your criminal record is clear. Was there another reason you would say it's very helpful? R:\tNope, not at all. I:\tWas there something particularly unhelpful or counterproductive about the program? R:\tNope. I:\tWould you recommend it to others? R:\tIf they could get in it, of course, yeah. One really happy thing they didthe guy downstairsinstead of asking for his $2.50 for the flagdid I say it was $2.50? I:\tYes, you did. R:\tHe asked for $670 so he could set up a surveillance system. I:\tAnd was that complaint ever received by anyone? R:\tBy the ... I:\tThe HOA? R:\tNo, by the people ... I:\tAt diversion? R:\tAt diversion. I:\tOh, as a restitution. R:\tAs a restitution. And they said, denied. Denied. So yeah, and they gave me a little satisfaction on that. I:\tAnd are there any issues you think that need addressing with how the diversion staff treats its clients? R:\tJeez, that's a tough question, because, you know, I didn't belong there. And the people that belong thereyou know, I don't know how they felt. So you knowthat's too hard of a question for me to answer. I:\tAnd did the program prepare you to deal with challenges after you were all done? R:\tNo, no. They didn't come here and arrest the guy downstairs, okay? Now that would have been goodfor false accusation and all that, you know. I:\tAnd kind of going back to that situation where you were in 850 Bryant, what was the first day like for you after your release? Do you remember what you did? R:\tI had a nice meal with my wife. And I fell into a major depression. And over the next month, I would wake up in sweats. And it was not a pleasant time at all. I:\tDo you feel like you were able to go outside and interact with people? R:\tNo, no, I stayed inside. But I normally stay inside anyway. I mean, I go out, ride my bicycle occasionally. Even less now, when that poor lady got hit. Right on my bike routes, somebody, you know, 50 miles an hour in the park killed a woman. Yeah. The shine is coming off San Francisco, especially now we find out the taxpayers are going to have to pay for the Millennium Falcon or whatever they call it. I:\tOh, I'm not familiar with that. R:\tOh, the Millennium Tower is tilting. I:\tOh, yeah. R:\tAnd we're going to pay for it, because we want our public transportation system, whichthe people that live there never use public transportation. They have chauffeurs, yeah. I:\tSo going back to the ... R:\tSorry. I:\tNo, no, it's okay. It's okay. After you were releasedso did you know what you were going to do next, the first day that you got out? R:\tTake my medication. I:\tSeems like a good thing to do. R:\tYeah. I mean, that's as far ahead that I was thinkingand help heal my wife, because I think she took more of a hit than I did emotionally, even though, you knowyeah, I think she took more of an emotional hit on it than I did. I:\tDo you feel like you were able to support that relationship and mend things when you got home? R:\tYes, yes, we healed well. I:\tAnd about how long do you feel like that took? R:\t[name]? OV:\tI don't know. R:\tAt least six months. She doesn't like to talk about herself. I:\tAnd what was the toughest adjustment that you had to make in the first month? R:\tFreeing myself of my nightmares, I guess, because I do something called intentional dreaming. I do a lot of my work at night in the sleep state. I do a lot of my computer design work then. And it was very hard to get that back. I'm there now. I mean, you know, I could dream of code all night now. But that first year, it was lost. I:\tAnd do you feel like your work was affected because of that? R:\tOh yeah, I didn't work. I didn't even look for jobs. In fact, I called myself retired when everybody called. And I could have. I mean, you know, it's not as if I had to work. But then, you know, this major global company came around, and, you know, that is moreyou know, getting this job with all these people that respect me across the world is, you know, more the thing, besides my wife's support, that's the thing that has healed me much more, even though, you know, it's a pain in the ass working with 20-something-year-olds. But I'm literally the oldest guy in the company. And, you know, it's still fun. Also, I've never worked with women in the office before. I:\tIs that something you do now? R:\tOver half the population are women. And, you know, what surprises me the most is how many of them become pregnant. I:\tIn the workplace? R:\tI don't know if they did it there. I:\tSo I assume that they go on leave, and you see this all the time. R:\tWell, I've never been around pregnant women in my whole life. I mean, the only woman that worked in my previous companies ran the taco truck. And you can tell if she was pregnant. But here, you knowit's kind of bizarre, you know. Life goes on, you know. I:\tSo going back to the release, how did you support yourself financially at the time? R:\tSavings. I mean, that's normal for my kind of business. You know, you have stretches where, as [name] said OV:\tFeast or famine. I:\tAnd following your release, were you given access to any programs, to healthcare ... R:\tDidn't need it; didn't ask for it. Oh, we did get Obamacare. And it took our $1,600 a month Kaiser bill down to $350 or $450, something like that. OV:\tIt's $425. Yeah, [02:16:57 inaudible]. R:\tSo we got Obamacare because I wasn't working. That was the amazing part about it. You know, we filled out the forms, and then they weren't working, so we called. And she justyeah, we're going to pay for most of your medical bill. And that took a big amount of the stingyeah, $1,600 a month is a lot for healthcare. I:\tAnd were there any programs or services post-jail that you would have wanted that weren't offered? R:\tYeah, I mean, I think, ideally, there should have been aI mean, the whole thing stank to high heaven. I mean, just having the charges reduced by that much. I really think somebody from the Attorney General's office should have investigated and arrested the guy downstairs who obviously filed false police reports. I mean, you know, I've read all the emails, because the lawyer did give me the entire case fileand probably because she doesn't own a filing cabinet. You know, I got the whole thing, and I read all the emails and all the reports. I mean, every single neighbor had something bad to say about me, because I got the police reports of all their interviews. And I think that the District Attorney's office should have investigated this, and brought those people to justice. I:\tDo you feel like your detention affected the relationship with your family members for the better or for the worse? R:\tFamily members outsideit was worse between my wife and I for a while. But, you know, we did rebuild. I:\tAnd that was something you felt initially? R:\tYeah. I mean, she was just as much in a state of shock as I was. I:\tBecause it was just between you and your wife, the rest of your family didn't provide you with any support? R:\tThey don't know about it, and they never will. I:\tAnd did your relationship with your friends change for the better or for the worse? R:\tI did drop one friend, because two friends, we could not stop from having the information, because, you know, they were here. You know, they were regular visitors, and they would show up, and I wouldn't be here. Where's [name], you know? And one of them told a third friend, which to them was a friend, but to us was, you know, an acquaintance. And I jettisoned him immediately, and told him, never talk to anybody about that. And I don't want to see you ever again. I:\tAnd did your other friends provide you with any support after what happened? R:\tSympathy. That's about it. I:\tAnd you did not tell your daughter, so your relationship did not change. R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. Didn't tell my mother, either. I:\tAnd following your release, how many places did you live within the first year? You've been here this whole time? R:\tOh, yeah. We moved in here in '96. You know what the rent is on this place when we move out? OV:\t[name]. R:\tIn case you're looking. I:\tYeah, just in case I can't afford it. So what are the pros and cons to living here for you, both then and now? R:\tBefore, I felt like a member of a community. I felt like I participated. I felt like, you know, I was, you know, appreciated. And once I read through all those emails, found out that was a total illusion. They were just using me. So there's pro/con there. Physically, it has not changed. I'm living in heaven, okay? I have the ocean across the street. I have the grocery store across the street. I have one of the most beautiful urban parks in the world across the street. I could walk to three major world-class museums. I mean, yeah, that has not changed. What has changed is my attitude about my city, which, you know, it sucks. I:\tAnd the pros and cons of living here nowhave those changed at all, like your relationships with the HOA or with your neighbors? R:\tThey fined us $2,000. I:\tFor? R:\tFor this whole incident. On top of everything, then they turn around; they throwand the maximum fine they were able to throw was $150. But then they changed the rules so they could fine me $2,000. And they'll get that money over my dead body. I:\tSo you have not paid that fine. R:\tOh no. They can't charge interest on it. I:\tAnd how do you tell them that you can't pay it or won't pay it? R:\tWe won't pay it. We just pay our dues every month, exactly on time. I:\tAnd are you receiving any negative consequences because of that? R:\tOh, all the time. Yeah, they keep on writing, must be paid, must be paid. No, they'll get it over my dead body. Then my daughter will find out. I:\tSo we're going to go to the strongly agree to strongly disagree. These are statements about your neighborhood. And this is immediately following your release. \"In my first month out, I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live.\" R:\tYes. I:\t\"It was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood.\" R:\tIt's not hard to stay out of trouble. You know, there's no trouble here, unless you're a stupid guy that goes into the water. I:\tYeah, not that one. \"I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood.\" R:\tYes. I:\tAnd who were they? R:\tThe guy that falsely accused me and the entire HOA board members. I:\t\"Drug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood.\" R:\tOne guy offered to sell me Viagra once. I:\tSo I assume it's not a major problem, then. R:\tI don't think it is. I:\t\"I think my neighborhood was a good place to live.\" R:\tYeah, it is. It's a very good place to live, as long as, you know, you don't have assholes for neighbors. I:\t\"I cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions.\" R:\tNo, not anymore. Used to; not anymore. I:\tBefore the incident? R:\tYeah. I:\t\"If there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who lived there could get it resolved.\" R:\tNope. I:\t\"I expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time.\" R:\tWell, our original planwe still may come back, when we get into our 80s. You know, I mean, it is an ideal place to, you know, check out from. I:\tAnd the statements I just read you immediately following your releasedo you feel the exact same way now about your neighborhood? R:\tYeah, yeah, yeah. It was all real-time. I:\tBecause you haven't changed your place of residence. R:\tNo, I haven't changed. I don't forgive people. I'm not Christian. But then I don't take revenge, eitherwhich is, when you come to think of it, very Christian. I:\tAnd with regard to housing, what are your future goals, and how do you want to achieve them? R:\tItaly, probably around Florence. I:\tAnd how long do you think that's away? R:\tWell, it was going to be this year, but now what we're looking at is at least a year and a half, but the global company who's doing an installation in Milan  you know, I may be able to move to Italy sooner than what I thought. The nice thing about moving to Italy for me is, I spend a year without crossing the border, and I'm an Italian citizen. I get an EU passport, yeah. I:\tIs that something that you want? R:\tOh, yeah. Don't you want one? I:\tYeah. R:\tYou know, with an EU passport, you could go to school for free. I:\tSo moving onto criminal recordto what extent do you agree with the following statement? \"Having a criminal record has made it very difficult for me to find work.\" R:\tOh, it does. I:\tIt does? R:\tNo question about it, in my field of work. I:\tBut have you experienced that personally? R:\tNo, because I have no criminal record [02:27:04 crosstalk]. But, you know, it's a fact, you know. Somebody that could do to a computer what I could do to a computeryou don't want him if he's been arrested. I:\tAnd is that something you ever had to tell an employer or anything like that? R:\tNo, no, because, you know, everything's expunged. I:\tAnd where do you see yourself in terms of employment in the next year? R:\tMost likely the same contract. I:\tNext five years? R:\tRetired, 100 percent. I:\tAnd I assume ten years is the same? R:\tOh, yeah. Well, you know, I'll still be doing my mentoring thing, you know. We stick mostly to young ladies that, you know, are trying to start a technology company. I:\tIs there a reason for that? R:\tI get along much better with women than I do with men. [Name] does, too. And yeah, I'm not a man's man. I never was. I prefer the company of women. I:\tAnd moving onto financial obligations, have you incurred any debt because of your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tDebt? No. Well, except the thing I mentioned already. I:\tYeah, the fine that you're not going to pay. R:\tRight. I:\tAnd in general, how would you say your criminal justice obligations have affected your life? And these are court dates; these are diversion requirements; obligations. R:\tIt made a major effect on me, a complete loss of faith in the United States. I:\tAnd you're saying that about R:\tMy contact with the criminal system here, yeah. I've lost all faith. I:\tIs there anything that's important to you that we haven't talked about today? R:\tWe've touched on a lot, you know. I'm a ruminator, you know. As I said, a lot of my good thinking is done in my sleep. So you know, you'd have to ask me that question tomorrow, because something may or may not pop up, yeah. I:\tIs there anything that you would suggest for us in future contact, because these are sensitive subjects? R:\tDon't you dare let anybody find this stuff out, okay? You already know that my family doesn't know. And I'm making it quite clear that if any employer has access to this information, you know, I'm fired, okay? So you know, I mean, I realize she had a little bit of a disclaimer in there, but I would ask you personally to make sure that these are randomized as quickly as possible. I:\tNot a problem. R:\tDoes [name] have to see it with my name on it? I:\tShe will not see it with your name on it. R:\tCool. So please commit to me, as your personal responsibility, that this is totally anonymized, because I am used to this, you know, because with HIPAA and all of the medical stuff I've been doing all my life, I know it's perfectly possible to detach the data from the person. And, you know, please do your job on that. I:\tAbsolutely. And do you have any questions for me about the study or anything like that? R:\tAre you going to get your name on the paper? I:\tMaybe. That's a possibility. R:\tThat would be very cool; a sharing PA. I:\tQuite possibly [02:30:57 crosstalk]. R:\tA principal investigator, right? [Name] is the PI, and you're ... I:\tAn RA for now. R:\tYou're an RA. I had good times as an RA. I really had good times as an RA. I:\tI'm enjoying the experience. R:\tYeah, you really get a feel, yeah, if you're going to have this career. [End of Audio] End SF300    SF300\t\tPage 56  \n",
      " I:\tWell, I will be recording. But let me know if you ever want me to stop the recording at any time. R:\tOh, no, it'll be fine. I:\tOkay. Here's a copy of our consent form. Take as much time as you need to read over that. R:\tOkay. I:\tAnd here's a copy for you to hang on to, too. R:\tThank you. Is that your professor? I:\tYeah, yeah. She's the one that's in charge of the study. R:\tOh, that's so cool. I didn't know that they have studies with that. I:\tYeah, it's kind of a new thing because diversion is  I mean, San Francisco has had some programs for a while. But nationwide, they're not a big thing yet. R:\tNo. Is it just the pretrial diversion, or are you guys doing the supervised pretrial release as well? I:\tI think that's on here. Maybe one of the questions asks  it's got a list of programs that you've done, and I think it might be on there. I don't remember. R:\tBecause I know that the supervised pretrial release, which is the SPR Programthat's what I'm on now, toothat, I believe, is more like the major felonies and stuff. And then I think pretrial diversion is usually the first-time offenders and stuff like that. That's what they told me. Because I was like, \"What's the difference?\" [Laugh] I:\tYeah. Yeah, I'm not sure. Since Prop 47 happened, it sounds likeI don't know   R:\tOh, yeah, I'm sorry. It gets a little windy back here. Okay. How long have you been going to UC you said? I:\tYeah, this is my first year. R:\tFirst year? I:\tYeah. This summer, yeah. R:\tWhat high school did you go to? I:\tOh, Idaho. R:\tOh my goodness! Oh, that's so cool! I:\tKind of a long time ago. Yeah, I've been  R:\tThat's hell of cool. I:\tTook a break and then went to grad school. R:\tOh, so you were in grad school out there? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tThat's really cool. My sister, she went to UC Santa Cruz. And she really wanted to get into Berkeley, but it's really hard to get into Berkeley sometimes. I:\tYeah. As an undergrad, I hear it's pretty hard. As a grad student, I think not so much. It depends on the program you're doing. R:\tThat is definitely true. So what are you majoring in? I:\tSo actually I taught special education for ten years, and so I'm in the program for special ed. But most of the work that I've been doing is more just sociological education-related stuff. Does that make sense? R:\tIt does. That's really cool actually. I:\tYeah. And this lady is in the Department of Sociology. R:\tOh, my sister actually graduated with her major in sociology. And then she minored in language. So she knows Italian, Spanish, Korean, and she's learning Japanese right now, too. So she's actually going back to do her Master's in Korea. She's leaving in January [laugh]. I:\tOh, wow. That's crazy. R:\tThat is really cool. I:\tDo you have any questions before we start? R:\tNope, that's pretty much it [laugh]. I:\tAll right. Well, this is your copy. I mean, do you want to set it under something so it doesn't fly away? R:\tThank you. Yeah. I:\tOkay. So I'm going to start by just asking you some questions about your background. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tHow old are you? R:\tI'm 26. I:\tOkay. And your birthday? R:\tIt's 10/30/1989. So October 30, 1989. I:\tOkay. And where were you born? R:\tSan Francisco [laugh]. [Dealing with dog] I:\tOkay. So if you could, choose from this list or category that best describes how you self-identify in terms of race and ethnicity, and then how others perceive your race and ethnicity. R:\tOh [laugh]. I:\tSame thing. Okay. R:\tI got Indian mixed, Filipino, Black, all kinds of stuff. I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" I:\tOkay. And your present marital status? R:\tI am single. I:\tNever married? R:\tNever married. I:\tOkay. Any kids? R:\tNo. I have stepsons, but no kids of my own. I:\tOkay. Highest level of education you've completed? R:\tUmm, first year of college. I:\tOkay. And did you receive any help in school with academics, like tutoring, reading or math help, special ed, things like that? R:\tYeah, I did receive math tutoring. I was never good at math [laugh]. I still am not good at math. I:\tBut you weren't in special ed or anything? R:\tNo. Uh-uh. I have a twin sister, and that's my sister who went to UC Santa Cruz. She was actually in special ed, but only in the beginning. And then she mainstreamed. I:\tOkay. But you didn't ever have to? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tOkay. And how do you support yourself financially? R:\tUmm, I work full-time. I:\tOkay. And how much money do you earn? R:\tUmm, I would have to say  hold on. That's when the calculator comes out. I:\tIt could be by hour, by year, or by month, whatever. R:\tIt varies. It's like $17 an hour.  I:\tOkay. And then your total household income? There's a range. So between $10,000 and $20,000, $20,000 to $30,000  R:\tOkay, in my household, that's just me then. Hold on. That's for the year? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tThat is, umm oh my gosh. Seventeen times eight. That's 136. Times 5  680. Uh, times  what is it? Times two? I don't know. I'm really bad at math, as you can tell. I'm like, \"Uh.\" I don't know. Whatever $17 an hour is. I'm super bad. You don't even know. I'm horrible when it comes to math [laugh]. I:\tWe can do this. No worries. Let's see.  So $17 per hour times eight hours a day, times five days a week, times 52 weeks a year. $35,360? R:\tYes, that seems right. [Interruption] R:\tYeah, so that sounds more right. I just actually started doing this job. I used to be working in the restaurant industry. I used to be a server, so I'd make more so around $44,000 a year when I was doing that. But this is different. I just haven't calculated it yet [laugh]. I:\tOkay, no worries. Okay, so now I'm going to read some states that describe how you may feel about your current relationships with your family. So \"family\" in this case would mean blood or legal relatives, significant others, or guardians that you've lived with. Okay? So on scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, what would you say to: \"I feel close to my family\"? R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. \"I want my family to be in involved in my life.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t\"I consider myself a source of support for my family.\" R:\tA sense of emotional support? Strongly agree. I:\tOkay. \"My family is a source of support for me.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. \"I fight a lot with my family members.\" R:\tNo, not anymore. When I was younger, yes. I:\tYeah?  \"I often feel like I disappoint my family.\" R:\tUmm, strongly disagree. I:\tOkay. \"I'm criticized a lot by my family.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tOkay. And same kind of thing. \"I have someone in my family I can count on to listen when I need to talk.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tHow many people in your family would you say you could do that with? R:\tUmm, at least five different family members. I:\tOkay. \"I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.\" R:\tYes. I:\tSame amount of people? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay. \"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.\" R:\tSay that one more time. I:\tSure. \"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.\" R:\tAgree. I:\tStrongly or just regular? R:\tJust regular. I:\tOkay. And then less amount of people that would do that? R:\tYeah. Maybe like one. I:\tOkay. Like your mom or your sister? R:\tMy aunt. I:\tOkay. \"I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job.\" R:\tUmm, strongly agree. I:\tThe same one? R:\tUmm, it would be probably  it goes back to the same five family members. I:\tOkay. \"I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. Same five? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. \"I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed.\" R:\tStrongly agree. That would be two people. I:\tOkay. Less people that would drive you places? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. \"I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support.\" R:\tUmm, financial support? I'm the only one who does that. It'd probably be just my boyfriend, and my aunt maybe sometimes. Yeah. I:\tOkay. Your mom wouldn't? R:\tMe and my momwe're good again, but we've had a lot of falling out before. And me and my auntit's more close as a mother and daughter like that than my own mom. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. Does your mom live around here? R:\tShe does, yeah. I:\tOh, obviously, right?  R:\tYeah. But like I said, we've started becoming, you know, a little bit more closer and stuff. But there has been times and stuff when I was younger where it was really rocky. I've been living in and out of homes since I was like 16. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Well, that kind of leads into the next question. So this says: \"Family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also influence us to do things that are not in our best interest or be sources of stress.\" So can you describe some relationships with your family that provide examples of supportive and of stressful influences on your life? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tSo what are some examples of really supportive ways that they've been, and then examples of how they've been stressful? R:\tSupportive ways. Like, right now, I'm out on bail right now for the supervised pretrial release case. When I had gotten arrested  well, actually I turned myself in because I was going to get arrested eventually. But I had turned myself in for it. What had happened right awayI was already working. And my aunt and my mommy mom got a little bit more involved. But they didn't want to see me in jail like that, especially since it's been at leastApril, May, June, Julyit's been like a year and four months now since it's happened. And if I didn't get bailed out, I'd still be in jail right now. So they kind of see it as it's more so helping me. And they want to help me because they know how jail is, and they've seen how it is. It doesn't rehabilitate people. It doesn't at all. And I don't do good in jail [laugh] I get a lot skinnier. The food is really bad in there. They don't have a lot of rehabilitation type of activities to do in there. You can literally sleep all day, be lazy and, you know, it's different. It's not healthy. So that's why they were so for wanting to bail me out. Excuse me. I'm like, ugg, soda. I:\tNo worries. So you mentioned that your momthat relationship has been rocky since early on. Can you talk a little bit more about that? R:\tIt has. My mom and dad had a really codependent relationship. Basically, I've had a rocky relationship with my dad, too. It's justit's kind of weird to saybut I get along better with them when I'm not living with them. My mom and dad are actually legally separated now, so they don't live together. But when we all did live together and they were married and stuff, it was just like my dad had always made it an issue, thinking that we can just be on our own. And why do, you know, we have to be at home? Or why do we have to have our parents help still? And it's like, \"Hey. Just because you guys were kicked out earlier back in the day, it wasn't like how it is today.\" You know, so it's a lot different. And so he was more so on the old school hype of, you know, \"If we can do it at a young age, so can they.\" You know? So he was really hard, more harder. And my mom, she was so codependent with him because he had made more of the money at home. So it was kind of like she wanted to keep her house and, you know, still be financially good. But she realized that it wasn't worth it after a while. It was just too many problems in the end. Just I guess not trusting in the end and stuff because my dad ended up cheating on my mom and all kinds of other things. He was always in and out of jail kind of, too. So I think that my mom finally kind of got sick and tired of it. She's not codependent anymore because she learned by going to going to Al-Anon programs and stuff like that. She's had to learn herself how to, like, live without him, too, because they were together for like 35, 36 years. Yeah. So that's pretty much on that. I:\tAnd your relationship with your mom got better when they split? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. Or when you moved out? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. So the next set of questions is about relationships with people outside your family. So if you think about three people with whom you feel closest to personally, such as friends, and doesn't include family or a romantic partner. So how many friends up to three do you feel closest to? R:\tUmm, I feel closest to, honestly, by like two friends. I:\tOkay. Okay, so for the second friend, is this person male or female? R:\tFemale. I:\tOkay. And then how would you describe her race or ethnicity? R:\tUmm, she's biracial. So she's Mexican and White. I:\tOkay, I'll just put \"multiracial\" then. And what's her age? R:\tUmm, she's 21. I:\tAnd the highest level of education she completed? R:\tUmm, she is a third year in college. I:\tAll right. And is she working for pay? R:\tUmm, she's working as a server. I:\tOkay. And is she receiving any kind of public aid? R:\tNo. Besides financial aid, that's it. I:\tYeah. Okay. Married or living with a partner? R:\tUmm, she's living with her best friend, so she's single. I:\tOkay. And for the first friend that you were thinking of, male or female? R:\tFemale. I:\tRace or ethnicity? R:\tWhite and Chinese. I:\tOkay. So multiracial also? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd what's her age? R:\tUh, she's 25. I:\tOkay. And highest level of education she completed? R:\tUmm, high school. I:\tOkay. Is she currently working for pay? R:\tWhat do you mean? Employed? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. Is she receiving any kind of public aid? R:\tUmm, I want to say she gets  I don't know if she's getting CalFresh or CalWORKs. I don't know. I think she might be getting welfare. I'm not sure. I:\tOkay. Is she married or living with a partner? R:\tUh, no. She's single. Just living with her daughter. I:\tOkay. Okay, so now I'm going to ask you some questions about groups or organizations that you may be a part of and that you could receive emotional or material support from. So do you belong to a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? R:\tNo. I:\tRecreational club? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tSports team? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tMusic or artist group? R:\tNo. I:\tCrew or a gang? R:\tNo. I:\tLocal government? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Civic association? R:\tNo. I:\tAny other support groups? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Okay, so now I'm going to ask you some questions about your employment history. So how old were you when you had your first job? R:\tSixteen. I:\tOkay. How much of your adult life have you been employed for? All, most, some, little, or none? R:\tAll. I:\tOkay. And what kind of skills do you bring to the labor market? So you talked about being a server and then  R:\tI have really good customer service skills. I'm very patient. I do very, very well under pressure, especially under fast-paced environments. I can definitely make a fast-paced environment seem very relaxed, especially when you have needy people and stuff like that. I don't try to let anything get to me too much. So I just try to reassure anyone around just to, you know, relax. \"We've got it.\" You know? \"So anything you need, we can take care of.\" I:\tOkay. What kind of work are you doing now? R:\tRight now, I actually work for a government assistance program, and that's [place. And basically what it iswe distribute lifeline phones. I:\tOh, okay. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. So anyone who qualifies for a lifeline phone would need either program-based or income-based. And what it is is if you're program-based, either you have an EBT, Medi-Cal card, SSI, WIC, subsidized housing, which is Section 8, you can either be on disability, workman's comp, stuff like that, low-income energy. Or if you're income-based, you would have to make at least $25,700 or under. So it's basically 150% of the poverty gap. I:\tOkay. And do you like what you're doing now? R:\tI do. It's very rewarding because I like to help people. I like being around people and meeting people, and that's why I liked serving. As far as the money goes, it's different. I'm so used to making money every day and seeing it, and I can be more flexible with it. As far as this goes, I've had to make a lot of different changes when it came to spending and stuff like that. So I've had to sacrifice a lot of things and just have better ways of, you know, saving my money and just, you know, making it stretch. But I like it. Just, you know, meeting people, and helping people out, and knowing that, \"Hey, I helped a family out pretty much with a phone.\" And they can get connected, get a job now, you know, talk to their family, do what they need to do, build a resume. All that kind of stuff. You know? It's like an essential nowadays. Before that, we used to have lifeline phones for basically house phones. And so it's like, \"Who uses a house phone anymore?\" And so now we have cellphones. This is actually one of them. So they're like smartphones and everything like that. But, yeah, it's cool. I like it.  We travel to different areas. We cover Contra Costa County, Alameda County, and San Francisco County. And we're looking at expanding to Santa Clara County and also  what county is that? San Joaquin. I:\tAll right. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tA lot of travel. R:\tYeah. I mean, if you can travel, they'll definitely put you out there. But, you know, if you don't have a car and stuff, then you can carpool with somebody or you can, you know, work somewhere along the BART system. I'm so thankful that the BART system is around. I:\tYeah, it's super helpful. I feel like I've spent my whole life there lately. R:\tYeah. Anyone who is not from the Bay Area and they're coming here, they're like, \"It's the best.\" And it's like, \"Yes.\" I:\tIt really is. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAre there any things you're trying to learn now or that you want to learn in the future? R:\tUmm, I don't know. I'm always open and up to learning new things. So it just depends what's thrown at me. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. \"Take it as it comes\" kind of thing? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. What barriers to employment would you say you've had, if anyeducation, training, experience? R:\tWhat do you mean \"barriers to employment\"? I:\tHas it made it difficult to find work in the area that you want to find work in? R:\tNo. I:\tHow about transportation? R:\tTransportation, sometimes, only because I'm not allowed to drive right now. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Family obligations? R:\tNo. I:\tLack of jobs available? R:\tNo. I:\tEmployer discrimination? R:\tNo. I:\tCriminal record? R:\tNo. I:\tSubstance abuse? R:\tUmm, what do you mean? I:\tLike any drug issues, alcohol issues? R:\tI mean, I've had substance abuse issues. I'm actually on methadone right now. I used to be on heroin, but I'm not on heroin anymore. It all started when I  because I had endometriosis, which is like an ovarian cyst. And I would take painkillers in the beginning because I had surgery. So I would take Dilaudid, Norco, OxyContin, and stuff like that. And then I got cut off from my insurance, so I wasn't able to get those prescription medications anymore, leaving me to go fend for them on the street and buy them off the street. So it became really pricey afterward when, you know, you don't get covered for that anymore. So I wasn't able to pay for it anymore. And then I ended up trying heroin and finding that because somebody else who had the same situation as me. I ended up saying, \"Well, it's cheaper and it's the same thing, even though it looks gross.\" And I ended up doing it, and that's how I ended up starting. Now, it's been like five years later and I've been on methadone for a year, a year and a half now. And it's been a life-changer. It's been really good. It's been working out for me a lot better.  I:\tOkay. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo in the past, that's been a barrier for working for you? R:\tKind of because I wouldn't be  say, for instance, if I didn't have anything at the time, I wouldn't be able to go to work. It would be physically impossible. I couldn't go to work drenched in sweat and everyone is like, \"What's wrong with you? It's not even hot.\" [Laugh] Stuff like that. That was the only downside about it, is that I would have to make sure I was well before I went to work or anything, or else I wouldn't be able to work. But now that I've been on methadone, not only do I not have to worry about that, but it also helps for the pain management as well. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. Any issues with mental or physical health then? I mean, I guess kind of that's like a physical health. R:\tI mean, that's  yeah. But I guess that goes along with physical health. But I've gained a lot more weight than what I used to be these past couple of years. So I was a lot skinnier. I'm not skinny now, but I was skinnier. I:\tAnything like homelessness or housing stability? R:\tI have been homeless before. I was homeless for a year. It was like a year, a year and a half. It's different now. I mean, I've gotten cleaned up from that. And, you know, that's before when I was in and out of jail, or just making bad decisions because of that. And so I don't have to worry about that kind of stuff anymore. And just as long as, you know, I'm focused and, you know, I have goals and stuff like that set for me. So that's definitely what helps out a lot. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. So right now, you just hold the one job? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I'm actually looking for another job right now, too. I:\tIn addition to this one? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. What kind of work are you looking for? R:\tA serving job. I:\tOkay. What is your official job title at this job? R:\tSamaritan. I:\tSamaritan? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. And when did you start that job? R:\tUmm, in June  noMay 2016. I:\tAnd it's full-time? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay.  [Interruption] I:\tOkay. So for the job you have now, how did you find this jobfriends, agency? R:\tI found it actually coming back  I was walking back to the BART station for my court date. I:\tOh, yeah? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. They were actually distributing literally right in front of the welfare office in San Francisco off of 9th in Mission, and it was right around the corner from the pretrial diversion place. I:\tOkay. So you really  the employer contacted you? R:\tWell, I was walking by, and they were like, \"Hey. Do you need a free phone? All you need is your EBT card and Medi-Cal card.\" And I was like, \"Sure. Why not?\" You know, it wouldn't hurt to have another phone. Because then I was thinking about it like, \"I can have my personal phone with all my family and everything, and then I can have an alternate phone for people that, you know, I don't know or just, you know, that I gain to know and stuff like that, like networking and whatnot.\" So that's how it started. And then he really  we were conversating and stuff, and he really liked how I was just talking to people and the conversations I was keeping up with, and I was really professional about it. So he ended up offering me the job right away. I:\tOkay. Very cool. Is it typical of the kind of jobs you've had in the past? R:\tNo. I:\tI mean, it sounds totally different from serving. R:\tIt is different from serving. But also  my first job, I used to work at [place]. And I actually progressed in the company as a Digital Imaging Specialist. [Interruption] R:\tFrom a Digital Imaging Specialist to working in Geek Squad. Yeah. So basically stuff like that. I:\tOkay. So serving  R:\tRetail, electronics, and stuff like that. I:\tOkay. And those are really your experiences in the job market thus far? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAny other kind of work that you've done? R:\tJust retail, electronics, umm what else? I used to do a lot of  I guess you would sayI was in this program called Peers in Action basically. And what we did is we're like pure advocates. And we would go around to different campuses, and BARTS, and stuff, and basically inform people about, you know, living better and healthier, like sexual health. And if you do use drugs, how to safely use drugs. You know, because the AIDS epidemic in Alameda County and San Francisco County is actually one of the highest in the nation. So basically trying to have people aware of it. And just to, you know, better utilize the resources that are around and not a lot of people know. They have a San Francisco Drug Users' Union out there. And what it is, is they pretty much provide a place for people toand it sounds weirdto use. And they give you free access to clean syringes, tools that you need, cookers, pipes, stuff like that, things to put on your  so you don't touch people's mouths and stuff. You know, alcohol swabs, clean water, all that kind of stuff. Because, you know, sometimes they will just use whatever or use dirty things. They want to cut the AIDS epidemic basically. And then also they would provide Narcan. So that would help out a lot, too. And then the thing is they were trying to get people to go there because not only do they provide safe and clean stuff, but a safe place to use and to get going. But they had snacks there for, you know, homeless people. And they just want to make sure, you know, even though  a lot of homeless people, they feel like, \"Yeah, I'll go to jail if I use on the street.\" But, you know, if you had a spot where you could just use, get your things, and go, then, you know, they would at least think that it would contribute to at least trying to help out the stricken neighborhoods in San Francisco. As far as Oakland, I don't know too much, but I do know that they have a lot of needle exchange sites out there. And they do have them in the city, too. But they have a lot of portable ones in Oakland. So basically stuff like that. I:\tOkay. How come you quit doing that kind of work? R:\tUmm, I did that when I was in high school. So basically in high school. And then I was done with high school. It was just for seniors only. So basically that. And then if you were to go into any of the UCs, they did have that available back then. And that was like in 2006, 2007. So I don't know if they still have that now. But I remember we would always go to UC Berkeley. They went to UC Santa Cruz, but it's not really out there like that. It's more just, you know, towards San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, stuff like that. So they would go there. They would go to San Francisco State. They would go to different hospitals. They would go to, you know, the county hospitals and stuff. So basically areas that they know that people would probably go to if they had trouble or something like that. Just, you know, areas that  because usually end up seeing a lot of those people going into the county hospitals. Because if they don't have clean stuff to use, they'll end up getting abscesses, and they'll get infections. And, you know, if they're left untreated, you could die from it basically. So that's what they were just basically trying to get out there for people to use and utilize. I:\tOkay. Can you tell me about your most positive work experience ever? R:\tUmm, I had a pretty positive work experience with the program I was working in, Peers in Action. We literally made like  I think it was like 1,000 bag lunches. And we literally went all over. We went from Berkeley and Ashley BARTall over the BART line, literally. And we went to all the areas like in the Tenderloin, SoMa. All these areas where it was crazy, homeless, drug-stricken. And we just gave bag lunches out to everyone. And then we had in each and every bag lunch, we had, you know, a little pamphlet of what we do, why we're doing it, where you can find us. \"How would you like to join? Did you want to participate in doing this kind of stuff?\" And where to go. So basically just letting them know. And it was really, really good because a lot of people didn't know about the program and stuff. So it kind of makes you feel like you're kind of almost saving a life sometimes. Because if you can give somebody the opportunity to, you know, have access to stuff like that, you know, especially Narcan, that really helps because a lot of people are overdosing. So when they have that available, then it would save lives. I:\tOkay. How about your most negative work experience? R:\tUmm, I don't know. I mean, I've kind of learned to filter those out. But I did have one recently working with [place]. We asked people, \"Hey. Would you like a phone? It's free.\" And we're in Fremont, and we're just becoming to be out in Fremont. And the thing is, these Indian people, family, or whatever, they looked at us and they laughed. They were like, \"We already have phones. We all have iPhones.\" We're like, \"Hey. Well, if you have an iPhone for T-Mobile, you can use our service. And instead of paying like $100, $120, you could be paying $25. You can cut your bill literally in half, more than half, you know, and still have the same service.\" But they were like, \"Oh, well, we don't need that. That's for homeless people anyway. We make over $200,000 a year.\" They're just basically downgrading the program and stuff. And it's likeyou know, I'm the type of person that's like, \"How dare you?\" You know? [Name], come here. Come here, baby. So yeah, I basically am just likeI don't like it when people say that, especially when they're of ethnicity. Because if you really think about it, it's like, \"Okay, you came from India. You had to wait six years to come over here if you want to think about it like that.\" I didn't want to say it like that. I didn't say it like that, but that's what I was thinking. It's like, you know, how can you say that kind of stuff when you came to our country? And even me, you know, me being Latin, you know, my descendants had to come over here, too. So it's like everybody should just not have to think like that. You know? It's kind of ugly thinking like that. And it's like, you know, we all had to come from somewhere at one point, whether it was us or our descendants. So to say something like that is kind of just likeI don't know. I just thought it was really ugly, and I really wanted to say something really bad. It just makes me think like, \"What about your family that wasn't allowed to come here yet, or that is waiting to still come over here? They're living in poverty right now. And would you still be saying that to them?\" You know, it's kind of just like that. So I kind of felt really bad. I:\tOkay. So then the next block is about experiences you may have had with substance abuse, if any. So remember, all your responses are going to be kept private. So you mentioned a heroin thing. Have you ever had a problem with alcohol, or just drugs? R:\tWell, when I was 12, I had a problem with methamphetamine [laugh]. But the neighborhood that I was living in was really filled with drugs and stuff like that. Yeah, that was then. And then I had a cocaine issue when I was like 15, 16. And then 17, I was experimenting with ecstasy. And then 18 was painkillers. And then from painkillers, it was heroin. And then I used heroin for a number of years. And now I'm on methadone. So it's been good ever since. In a way, I'm kind of glad that I experienced it when I was younger. Because had I experienced it now, you know, I probably would have been on the mindset like, \"Ooh.\" You know? I would be interested. But I was interested back then and I'm not interested in it now. So I like it that it's the way that it is now. It's more like you live and you learn. I:\tOkay. Have you ever received treatment? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. How many times? R:\tI'm actually in treatment right now. The methadone program that I'm in is considered treatment. And I've been in treatment three times. [Interruption] I:\tOkay. So the next question just says, \"Describe the effects that alcohol or drug use have had on your life.\" So can you talk a little more about that? R:\tYeah, it has affected it when it comes to schooling and stuff. Like I said, I'm a twin. So my twin sister is more academically inclined and took school very seriously and stuff. Me, on the other hand, I cut class and I was more like, \"Hey. How can I make some money?\" I was using and also selling at the same time. So basically  because the thing is  I don't know, I just was the type that I was always wanting to go out. My sister, she didn't really like going out too much. And I was always just trying to be in the in-crowd and, you know, just live the fast life I guess. And now that I've had a taste of it and stuff like that, I'm more of a homebody now and I don't really care to go out so much [laugh]. I mean, I graduated late, so I was a fifth-year in high school. So that's probably one of the things that affected me from that, is definitely academics. I didn't take it seriously at first. And then my senior year, I had to literally get 100 credits in one year [laugh]. I:\tYou got it done? R:\tYeah, I got it done. I had to stay from school from like 6 in the morning till like 5 in the afternoon, but I did it [laugh]. I:\tBut drug use definitely impacted that? R:\tIt did, yeah. For sure. Because then I would want to get high and I wouldn't want to do my homework. I would just want to go out and kick it. And that wasn't the right thing to do. Because then afterwards, I seen all my friends graduate on time, and my sister, but not me [laugh]. So that really sunk in and it really hit me then. It all hit at the end. I was like, \"Fuck. I shouldn't have even done it like that. I shouldn't have partied so much or cut class so much.\" Because it's likelook, I'm seeing all my friends graduate on time. My sisterI mean, I had to go see her graduation and walk the stage and stuff. And I went toI don't know if you ever heard of James Logan High School. It's in Union City. It's one of the biggest high school in the Bay Area. And my graduating class is 1,200. So the school has 4,700 students, so it was a pretty big high school. They were really known for academics and scholarships, and their band, color guard, and extracurricular activities and stuff they were really known for. They had a really good program called the Puente Program, which my sister was in. And basically it was bridging success and stuff like that. So they got you prepared to go to college. And pretty much they did all  they set them up literally to apply for all these colleges and to get prepared to take the required classes that was needed to get into those schools. So I never took advantage of that. My sister did, and it was a really good program. I wish I did do it because they would literally get on you and make sure that you would, you know, do all your work. And everyone would have to get at least a 2.5. It wouldn't even be a 2.0. So yeah. I:\tDid your sister know that you were using what you were using? R:\tShe did. She did, but it was kind of an unspoken thing. I didn't really say anything or admit it, but I kind of did. Once I was 16 years old, I was very open about everything. Because I'm the type of person that is like, \"I'm not going to lie or hide anything. I'm going to be myself. And if you don't like it, at least you know. I'm not going to lie.\"  I:\tSo the next question is: \"Do you feel like you have a drug problem now?\" And you talked about the methadone. Is there a process for getting off of that? R:\tThere is because you can't just get off of it. Eventually I'm going to do a blind detox. And what a blind detox is, is where they're going to take away between two to 5 milligrams. Every couple of weeks, they're going to do that and I'm not going to know about it at all. I:\tOh, really? So you just go and they ? R:\tI just go and usually they'll tell me my dose when I'm at the window. When I'm on a blind detox, they're not going to tell me at all anymore. They're just going to give me the dose, and I'm going to think, you know, obviously  at first it's going to be what I'm dosing at. Right now I'm at 120 milligrams. They start everybody at 40 milligrams. So it's usually, when you get on their program, you have to find where you're going to be comfortable at and stay there for a minute. Then after, you go on a blind detox. So the program that I'm on is the maintenance. So I'll be maintenancing on 120 milligrams for a certain period of time. And then after, I'll switch to detox. And detox is the blind detox. I:\tOkay. And then what do they do, switch it with a placebo or something, or they just hand you whatever ? R:\tNothing. I:\tOkay. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tIs there a reason that it has to be blind? It's like a psychological thing? R:\tBecause  yeah. Addiction, especially opiate addiction, is very psychological. Very. So the mind tells itselfthe brainthat it needs the opiate to do everything. To live basically. You know? And not only that, but I'll get withdrawal symptoms. So hot, cold. I'll get shaky. I'll get sick sometimes. I took a while to get [inaudible 46:39]. [Interruption] R:\tYeah. So basically that's how that goes. It's more psychological. And then, yeah, it's a lot of physical aspects to it, too. That's why they want to do two to five milligrams and blind detox you every couple of weeks or every month. Because eventually, it doesif you just went cold turkey, I would be very sick. Anyone who would be on methadone would be very sick because it's an opiate. I mean, when you're an opiate dependent for so long, you will get withdrawal symptoms. You know, you can't eat. You'll get the shakes. It's almost like an alcohol detox. But in a sense, an alcohol detox, when you really think about it and get to know alcohol, it's more deadlier. Somebody who doesn't have opiates and just gets taken away like that, like a heroin addict or someone who's dependent on opiate pills like Norco, Percocet, OxyContin, that right thereI haven't seen anybody die cold turkey, although I have seen people, including myself, get very, very, very sick, throw up, not eat, sweat, not be able to sleep. It's bad. You would get really sick. And then there's those that are on alcohol who have literally been dependent on alcohol for years. And then when they don't have alcohol, they'll get the shakes. But those type of people, they can die. You can die if you don't have alcohol. And that happened to my nana actually. She was older, but she's always been a drinker from all her life. And she went to the hospital and, you know, in the hospital they're not going to give you alcohol. So it ended up making her congenitive heart failure even worse. So she ended up dying from that. So her congenitive heart failure ended up killing her, but it was due to alcohol detox. So basically that's how that goes. A lot of people don't think about it like, you know, \"Detox.\" But it does a lot to the body, especially if you've been dependent on it for a long time. So that's why they try to do it at such a little bit at a time, so you could be comfortable at the same time so you can get used to it. Because I'm going to have to get my body used to it for a little bit at that dosage. And then after, gradually just go down. I:\tOkay. That makes sense. Okay, so the next block is about mental and emotional health. So have you ever been told by a mental health professional, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, that you had a mental or emotional condition or that you showed symptoms of a condition? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tOkay. Have you ever thought you might have a condition that wasn't diagnosed? R:\tNo. I:\tHave you ever thought you might have a learning disability or a processing issue that wasn't diagnosed? R:\tYes. I:\tFor math? R:\tYeah [laugh]. I'm to the point where I was in algebra literally until my junior year. When it came to geometry, I didn't pass. I couldn't do it. It was so hard. Like, super, super hard. I literally had to have someone  I paid someone to literally help me pass. I:\tIs that what your sister was doing special ed for, too? R:\tShe was autistic. I:\tOh, okay. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. She was autistic and she grew out of it. I don't know, it's different. I didn't really pay attention to autism too much, but she didn't have a severe, severe case. But she eventually grew out of it. She's always retained information very well. But I do hear that, when people are autistic, they do end up retaining information very well and remembering certain things, and just stuff like that. They end up doing academically well or, you know, they'll be good at something. You know? She was always really good at everything that she did. Her knowing languagesshe knows like four fluent languages. It's crazy. I don't know how she does it. I:\tYeah. Wow. Have you ever taken medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of a mental or emotional condition? R:\tNo. I:\tHave you ever been admitted to a mental hospital unit or treatment program where you stayed overnight? R:\tYes. I:\tWas that for drugs, though? R:\tNo, I was younger. Because I was fighting with my mom and dad and stuff, and going through what I was going through with them just more so for attention I guess you would say. I just had a fit of rage, and I broke a mirror and I grabbed the glass. Because my parents were making me feel like I wasn't wanted, so I was like, \"You don't want me?!\" And basically stuff like that. We were having an altercation and I ended up stabbing my dad. It was bad [laugh]. I was 16. My dad was very abusive. So I was at the point where I was just done with it. I didn't want to deal with it anymore. And I was tired of dealing with him. So I was just like, \"I'm done with it. Leave me alone. If you touch me again, I'm going to kill you.\" Stuff like that. So that's why we've always had a rocky relationship and stuff. That was when I was living with them, though. So it's different now. I:\tOkay. And then you said you moved out when you were 16. Was that the time where you just didn't go back? R:\tYeah. Well, I ended up going to 5150. They 5150'd me. And I ended up staying in a mental hospital for kids. Then afterward, social services had came because obviously the situation at hand. And they had asked me, and then they had asked my mom if I was safe to go home. And she said it wasn't safe, so I ended up going to a group home for a year after that. And then after that, I ended up going back home when they let me go home from the group home because I did well or whatever. And then afterward, they ended up completing their parental programs that they were supposed to. And then after that, I moved back home for a couple months. It didn't work out again. Then I just moved out to a friend's house, and they let me. I:\tDid your sister stay at home during all that? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. As soon as she was done with high school, she moved to Santa Cruz. I:\tOkay. So have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional because of an emotional or mental health condition? R:\tNo. I:\tSo at that point when they had you stay at the 5150, they just kind of said you're clear? R:\tThey counseled me there and stuff and did everything there. But as far as post-care and stuff like that, no. I:\tOkay. So they were like, \"It's not attributed to an actual mental health problem. It's circumstantial\"? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. That makes sense. Skip that. You've never had to do court-ordered treatment or anything like that? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Do you feel like you have a mental or emotional condition now at all? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. We'll skip that one. Okay, so next I want to learn about your interactions with the police. So these questions may be sensitive or emotional to answer, so remember that you're not required to answer any question. And if you want to take a break or stop the interview, we can always do that. Okay? So approximately how many times have you been arrested? R:\tUmm, one, two, threelike six times. I:\tAnd for what offenses? R:\tUmm, the first offense was, umm god, what was that? Uh, reckless driving. And then I've been arrested for petty theft a couple of times. Well, once or twice. And then commercial burglary and conspiracy to commit a crime. That also was with that one, too. And then possession of paraphernalia. And driving in an unlawful vehicle, which is driving a stolen vehicle. And then also a felony hit and run. I:\tOkay. So you said possession of paraphernaliasorry, excuse me. That's different from drug possession, right? R:\tYeah. Possession of paraphernalia is basically pipes, or syringes, dirty spoons, anything that has to do with using a drug, a tool to use a drug. I:\tSo you didn't actually have drugs when you were arrested? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. And then you said possession of a stolen vehicle, but not actually motor vehicle theft. R:\tNo, it was a motor vehicle theft. That's what they had charged me with at first. But usually you'll get the bad charges, and then they'll reclassify your charges. So it was brought down to driving an unlawful vehicle\"Unlawful driving of a vehicle\" that's what it was. I:\tOkay. How old were you at the time of your first arrest? R:\tEighteen. I:\tOkay. So for the first arrest, could you describe the event from the minute you were approached by officers and taken into custody up till the point of your arraignment, assuming that you had one? R:\tI didn't. I was let go at the scene and I had to go back to a court date. I:\tThe first time? R:\tYeah. And then the first time I actually got arrested and went to jail was for the petty theft. At first, I was honestly not scared. I was kind of like, \"Ooh, I'm going to jail. All right. What's it all about?\" But then afterward, like the second time, I was like, \"Oh my god, I fucking hate this.\" So yeah, it sucked. But it's like a big, long process. You know, you get arrested and then pretty much, you know, it's like a waiting game. And it's freezing in jail. I:\tReally? R:\tYeah. They make people  they want you to feel very uncomfortable. So it's super cold even though it's indoors. They want you to freeze in there. You have to get nakedcompletely naked. Because before you go into a housing unit and you get your clothes and stuff, you're going to have to basically strip down, squat, cough. They have an officer pretty much right in your crack, in your vagina, and make sure they're looking in there. Sometimes they put a flashlight in there just to make sure that you don't have anything up there. That's why they make you squat and cough. So it was kind of like  I don't know, it's kind of demoralizing. I don't know what the word is, but dehumanizing. I don't know, it was just very weird. You know, you really feel like an inmate when you're in there and have to go through that. You were stripped of all your rights. That right there just made me really feel down a lot. \"I'm not just a regular person anymore. I don't have no rights.\" You know, and you have somebody literally having authority over you all the time. It sucks. And they don't ever call you by your name. Your last name is your name. It's either that our  your PFN number, which is your prison file number. So it's like that. But just the entire process of going through it just sucks. San Francisco County is a lot faster than Alameda County. In Alameda County, you get arrested, you're not going into a housing unit for at least a day almost. So you'll be in a holding cell with the same clothes on probably for almost 24 hours. So it sucks. In San Francisco County, they're a little bit more quicker. But it's always a process, regardless, either way. I:\tOkay. Do you feel like the times that you were arrested that you were treated fairly or treated respectfully? R:\tIn the beginning, maybe. Umm, I don't know. It just all depends to be honest with you. Because I ended up becoming really cool with one of the deputies. It's actually getting cold. Let's go inside [laugh]. But one of the deputies, as I was leaving. In jail, the release everybody after midnight, and they don't care if you have a ride or night. You're getting released after midnight, and that's how it goes. Unless you were sentenced already and, you know, you were in there for a minute, then you'll get released in the morning. But, yeah, no, for most of the time, it's like that. [Interruption] I:\tSo where were we?  R:\tSo basically when I was leaving jail, the county jail in Alameda County is called Santa Rita. And when I was leaving there, it was really, really weird. Because like I said, they'll release you after midnight. They don't care if there's rapists out there that they released before you or after you. You're getting released between 12 and 4 in the morning, even 5 in the morning. And the BART doesn't run until after 4. Sometimes it's 6 on the weekends, so it's kind of like you're stuck sometimes. And the walk from the county jail to the BART is like 45 minutes. So it's kind of like a messed up walk if you don't have anyone to pick you up. But we were leaving, and we're about to leave and literally get released. And I'm trying to plead with the guys with a group of girls that I'm with. And we're likeplease, officer, we're already getting released. Can you please just try to at least let us go before midnight, or at least before the BART stops running? Because, you know, we're girls. We don't want to be out there until 4 or 5 in the morning. We don't have nowhere to go. There's nowhere. And then we could get raped. As soon as we were done saying what we needed to say, he was like, \"Well, you better make sure that he leaves some DNA in you so we have something to work with.\" I was so appalled by hearing that. It's kind of just likewow. We're humans. You know? Just because we're in jail and we made a mistake doesn't mean that, you know, we're not any better than you. What if you had a daughter? Would you say that to your daughter? And we said that to him. And he was likewell, my daughter wouldn't be going to jail. And I was like, you don't know. You don't know if your daughter is never going to go to jail. For real, you don't know. How do you know some of these people didn't end up here for their first time? They had a drink and then they go behind the wheel on accident. They're just going home. You know? Something so petty, you know? Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, when it comes down to it, they don't care. They don't. They just see everybody as another inmate. So that's the only thing that sucks about jail. I:\tHow many times have you been convicted? R:\tUmm, three times. I:\tAnd for what offenses? R:\tUmm, you know, unlawful driving of a vehicle. I'm actually pleading to a felony on September 1st, which is the felony hit and run. And the reckless driving. Oh, I think that's four because I also pleaded for the commercial burglary.  I:\tOkay. How old were you with the first conviction? R:\tI was 19. I:\tOkay. Is that the burglary one? R:\tNo, it was the reckless driving. The commercial burglary was when I was 23. I:\tOkay. What is that? R:\tOkay, so commercial burglary is different from regular burglary. Commercial burglary is basically you are burglarizing a business, a placesay, for instance, Walmart or Targetany stores or stuff like that. That's considered burglary. And the thing is, what's different between burglary and theft is that theft is under a certain amount. It's like under $950. That's petty theft. And then you have, you know, stuff that's over that. And I believe that's considered either grand theftyeah, it's grand theft. But it's burglary is because we had burglary tools or we had stuff that looked like weapons and stuff like that when we come in there. And then pretty much they can do anything about it. But they seen who we were. So that's considered burglary because you're going in there, burglarizing a place, you have these tools on you and stuff, and it's not just  you're not just going there just to, you know, get a certain amount of stuff. You're going there for a specific reason. That's to really get into stuff. So basically it's just you have tools and whatnot and you're going into several places. For me, I went to several different Walmarts and I had gotten iPads. And the thing is, I was using tools and bending plexiglasses with tools and then getting the boxes out of them and stuff like that. So basically that's what it was. Several Walmarts in the county got togetherand they always do with LP, and this is what I found out and stuff. Loss prevention always gets together with the different stores that are around them. And if there is specific things getting taken that are ofyou know, and iPads are really expensive after a while, you know, the loss of the profit of that is very great. So they would want to investigate to see what the hell is going on. Well, if they see a certain face after so many times and whatnot, then that's, you know, a commercial burglary. And then also you know, conspiracy to commit a crime because I was with my boyfriend. And even though we weren't together coming in, we did leave together. So that's what makes it a conspiracy. I:\tOkay. And is this the same guy that you're with now? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. So what was the first conviction? R:\tThe first conviction that I got was the reckless driving. I:\tOkay. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat were kind of the circumstances that lead to that? R:\tUmm, I was actually trying to find parking at a funeral after-party, and I had a really loud racecar. So I was making a U-turn around the court to try to look for parking, and I went two times. But it was really, really loud and it had bad tires, so it kind of would go like [screeching sound]. So a lady had came out and she was in the corner house, and she had her kids outside or whatever. And she came up to me all rude and yelling at me like, \"What the fuck? I have kids here. Don't you fucking see that?\" And I was likehey, lady. Chill, dude. I'm just trying to find some parking over here. But I guess, you know, the way that I said it was not really caring I guess. So she really took that to offense. And then she had exchanged words with me, and then I started exchanging words with her because I was likehey, you're not going to come up to me like that. I don't fucking know you. She had a fork in her hand when she had came up to me. So she forked my car, the paint on it, and I had just got a brand new paintjob on my car. So I was pretty pissed off about that, and I said I was going to call the cops or whatever. And then she ended up socking me in my face.  The thing is, she was like as old as my mother. So there was no way I was going to do anything back to that because I'm like 18 years old, some little thin chick. She was going to sit on me. I'm like, \"I'm not going to do anything about that.\" So I just ended up calling the cops.  And then they came and they charged her with assault, and then they charged me with reckless driving. So it was a lose-lose situation [laugh]. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Were you arrested during that time? R:\tI was arrested and let go, so was she. I:\tOkay. That's a crazy story. R:\tYeah, it sucked. I:\tAt least she got something though, right? R:\tI mean, yeah. But at the same time, it's likefuck. I didn't think it was going to be like that. I was like, \"Why? I called you guys and you guys are charging me.\"  I:\tOkay. So the next set of questions is a reference to your experience with incarceration and probation or parole. So have you ever gone to juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Jail? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd you were 19 you said? R:\tEighteen. I:\tEighteen? How many times have you been in jail? R:\tLike six times  no, like five times. Yeah. I:\tOkay. And then how long total would you say that you served in jail? R:\tUmm, like seven months, eight months. I:\tOkay. And you ever been to prison? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Probation or parole? R:\tYes, probation. I:\tHow old were you when you got probation? R:\tTwenty-three. I:\tOkay. How many times have you been on probation? R:\tUmm, once. And then I'm going to be on felony probation soon. I:\tOkay. And how many months did you have to do probation for? R:\tUmm, three years. And then this one is going to be coming up to be five years. I:\tOkay. And is that because of the hit and run? R:\tYeah. So felony probation is always more. I:\tOkay. But did you serve jail time because of the hit and run? R:\tNo. I would have, but I was bailed out. It was a $100,000 bail [laugh]. I:\tOh, okay. Can you talk about that a little bit more? What was going on when that happened? R:\tUmm, well, basically the hit and runit happened in San Francisco. It was on the news. It was super embarrassing. I mean, my picture wasn't on the news, but the whole incident was just ridiculous. I lost my glasses during the first car accident that I had got. And the thing is, I had my friend in the car who I thought was my best friend. I had my boyfriend in the car, but he was sleeping in the back. And me and her were in the front. And basically she was kind of going through where she doesn't really talk to her family and, you know, she's barely on her feet renting from some lady. And so she's basically trying to strive to live and stuff. Well, we would always hang out and whatnot just so she could get out of the house. And I would let her, you know, borrow my car sometimes because she let me register in her name so I can get my tags because I was working in Santana Row at the time at [place] and there was always cops around there. So she said, \"Okay, I'll register it for you just so I can get my tags, and then I'll switch it back to my name.\" Well, as soon as I register it, not even ten days later, that accident happened and I hit a car. I mean, I had a pistol in the car but it was in the air filter. So there was no way that they would be able to find it. I mean, I don't think they ever did because it still hasn't arised to this day. And basically I pretty much was in the driver's seat, lost my glasses when I first hit the car. And she was like, \"You need to go! Go right now! Go, go, go, go! I can't lose my fucking house because of this!\" Because she had a warrant already for her arrest for some unpaid traffic tickets or some shit. But I was just scared at the time, so I was likeoh my god! Okay. I can't see! You need to direct me to go! And so she was likeokay, well, go left. Left, left! Go left, left, left! And I'm likeoh my god, I can't see! I can't see! Please try to find my glasses! As soon as I make a left, I hit three bicyclists. So it was a really fucked up situation. I feel really bad about it to this day. Yeah, one of them flew like 20 feet into a building and he was like 60 years old. It was horrible. I feel absolutely horrible for the whole situation. Then the other two people were treated and let go at the scene. But, still, you know, because I think about my sister. My sister, when she was in Santa Cruz, she would always bike everywhere, and she still does to this day. So it kind of reminding me of her. You know, it could have been my sister. Somebody could have hit her. You know? And I feel horrible for leaving the scene. But at that point, I had like almost 20 people on bikes wanting to literally rip me out of the car. It was very, very scary. So I was just like, \"Oh my god.\" As soon as I figured out what had happened, I had got sick. I had thrown up on myself in the car. And I was like, \"Oh my god, oh my god, I don't even know if I killed this man. I don't even know what's going on.\" And then my boyfriend snapped out of it and he was just like, \"You need to go!\" He tried directing me, and I was like, \"I can't see.\" And then he directed me to the point where I literally got away from everything and managed to get on the freeway and go. But along the way, my timing belt snapped, so I couldn't accelerate anymore. So I had to literally get off the freeway and pretty much ditch my car, which I was going through a moving process at the time. So I had to ditch literally all my clothes, everything that I had. Everything was just gone. My boyfriend's, too. So it sucked. I:\tYou never got it back? R:\tNo, never. I literally had to start from scratch all over again with clothes. It was the worst feeling in the world. So I mean, that's for that. But, yeah, it sucked. I:\tDid you hear about how the guy was? R:\tYeah. They ended up going to court and having to identify me. They all had to pretty much go to court to see if they could identify me. None of them could because I wore glasses to the court date, and I normally do wear glasses. But during that time, they seen me with no glasses because I didn't have any glasses. They were on the bottom floor of the car. I couldn't even see. Not just that, but I apologized to everyone that, you know, I feel horrible. So it was bad. I don't like thinking about that. I:\tOkay. Well, tell me if there's, you know, stuff you don't want to answer. R:\tI don't mind answering it. It just sucks. [Interruption] R:\tThat's fine. Yeah, so basically that's how it happened. I ended up turning myself in. Because my friend who I thought was my friendI thought that she was my friend. She tried to report the car stolen afterward. And I don't know why she tried doing that. We didn't tell her to do that. So she ended up doing that, and the cops kind of ended up busting her out. Like, \"Hey.\" Cops always have their way of trying to get people to tell a lie or not. Yeah, so basically  [Interruption] R:\tYes. So yeah. So basically after that, they ended up busting her out. And then she ended up telling them it was me and literally telling them everything about me. And then I ended up getting in contact with  because I have my boyfriend's friend who played football with him as they grew up. Well, he ended up working for an agencya police agency [inaudible 77:23] police. So basically he got in contact with me and was just like, \"Hey. If this is going on and if this isyou know, I'm hearing all this stuff. What's going on? It's on the news. What's up? Talk to me.\" He's like, \"You know, you need to help yourself out. Please turn yourself in. We can help you.\" And I was like, \"Okay. I'm going to end up doing it anyway.\" I felt horrible. I was not going to not do it because I think about my sister and how she was, you know, on a bicycle all the time. So it was like I wouldn't want that to happen to her. You know? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tSo basically that's it. You know? So I ended up doing that. And I got bailed out the next day because I had to work. I:\tOkay. So I'm going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about legal authorities. First, I'm actually going to put this off just because any time there's background noise, it gets  you know, hard to hear.  R:\tCool. Oh, that's cool. I:\tOkay. So let's go from strongly agree to strongly disagree. What would you say to: \"I feel like I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities\"? R:\tSay that one more time? I:\tSure. \"I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.\" R:\tDisagree. I:\tOkay. Somewhat or strongly? R:\tUmm, somewhat. I:\tOkay. \"People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.\" R:\tAgree. I:\tSomewhat or strongly? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tOkay. \"It's difficult to break the law and keep one's self-respect.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tOkay. \"The law represents the values of people in power rather than the values of people like me.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tOkay. \"People in power use the law to try to control people like me.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\t\"The law does not protect my interests.\" R:\tWait, what? I:\t\"The law does not protect my interests.\" R:\t[Laugh] Strongly disagree. I:\tIt's like a double-negative kind of there. \"Most police in my city do their job well.\" R:\tMmm  strongly disagree. I:\tOkay. \"Most police in my city treat people with respect.\" R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tIs there a situation that you're remembering about that? R:\tYeah. Last night, my boyfriend actually got arrested. I:\tOh, really? R:\tYeah. So I tried to give him a sweater just because I know how it is in jail. It's very, very cold, especially when you're waiting to be in a housing unit. So they didn't let me give him a sweater or anything. They just said, \"No, we're not going to do that. We don't accept any property.\" And it's like I've done it before where I gave him a sweater. And it's just like they were really cold about it and they just didn't care just because it's not happening to them. But it's like, you know, what if it was your family member and your family member had anemia? You know? They'd be freezing to death, and it's not cool. You know? It's almost inhumane, you know? To not  to think that it's okay, or to think that it's okay just to not give someone  or to make someone freeze like that for over 12-plus hours. So it's like that. And they always racially profile people and whatnot. It's just ridiculous.  [Dealing with dog.] I:\tSo how about this one? \"The basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by the police.\" R:\tHmm, the basic rights? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tI guess somewhat agree. I:\t\"The police in my city have too much power.\" R:\tUmm, I guess somewhat agree. I:\tOkay. \"Most police in my city treat some people better than others.\" R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. And you talked about racial profiling. What kind of experiences have you had with that? R:\tUmm, just they racial profile all the time, whether you're black or brownwhatever. They're just going to treat you like a minority. Everyone is low-income almost. You know? If you're a Mexican or Black, you're low-income. I:\tThey just assume? R:\tThey just assume right off the bat you don't have no money or you come from a poor neighborhood or whatever. It's fucked up. Excuse my language, but it is. I:\tDon't worry about it. R:\tYou know, and they just base it on, you know, how your criminal history is, if you have any background. Or if you don't have a background, they're just going to judge you just because you live in a certain area that you are a certain demographic or whatever. You know? It's just stupid. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, or questioned by the police? R:\tYes. I:\tHow many times would you say in your life? R:\tTwo times. I:\tAnd when was the last time that that happened? R:\tUh, it was actually like two months ago. I had got pulled over. Well, me and my boyfriend, we had got pulled over close to our house. And the thing is, this area is an unincorporated Alameda County, so there's no police here. It's the sheriff. So it's Alameda County Sheriff, and the sheriffs actually work in the jails a lot, in the county jail. So he's grown up seeing them being in and out of jail. Well, we got pulled over by a cop that he knew because he was in jail before. And the cop ended up letting us go. But he knew that we were on probation, so he wanted to do a quick probation search. So he did. And as he did, he not only searched him, but he searched me and he didn't have a female officer search me. He searched me himself, a male. And he put his hands underneath the cups of my boobs and everything like that, and just, you know, did everything like how he would with a man. So it was kind of violating, but he let us go. So I can understand why he let us go, you know, because he's doing stuff like that. You know? If I had went to jail which we wouldn't have went to jail anyway because we didn't have anything illegal on usbut if anything like that did arise, you know, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't me to go to jail or whatever because it's like you're not even supposed to  the protocol is you're not supposed to have a male search a female. Period. So basically that  I:\tDid you complain or anything? R:\tI didn't file a complaint just because I thought about, you know, we have suspended licenses and, you know, we were in a car and, you know, he could have towed the car and he didn't. So I was thinking more like that. If I would have pressed the buttons too much, then I would have probably been fucking myself over. Pretty much like that. I:\tWhat is your boyfriend's ethnicity? R:\tUmm, he's Puerto Rican. I:\tOkay. So to what extent do you think race has shaped your appearances with the police in general? R:\tUmm, it's shaped it very well. They're just not cool. They are very judging right away. They think that, you know, we're druggies, or just poor or, you know, on welfare. You know? Or we're loud because Mexicans are always loud, or Black people are loud. You know, it's just the typical stereotypes. They always stereotype, no matter what. I:\tSo the next set of questions are about the arrest that led up to your most recent pretrial detention experience, so the time that you spent in jail waiting for a decision on your case. And this is the hit and run, right? That's the most recent thing? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. When you finally were stopped by the police, were you read your rights? R:\tI wasn't stopped. I:\tOh, you went in? R:\tYeah, I turned myself in. I:\tThat's right. Okay. I remember you saying that. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tDid they treat you fairly when you were there, when you went in? R:\tYeah, they actually questioned me. They wanted to know my side of the story. And then afterward  I was booked immediately afterward. Once I was done with the interview with the detective, I was booked, and pretty much I was waiting in jail. And then once the bail went through, then I was bailed out. I:\tDid you know that they were going to book you right then and there? R:\tYeah. I:\tYou had kind of planned for it? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. And how long were you there for? R:\tUh, I was there for 13 hours. I:\tOkay. So these next set of questions are kind of about your experiences in detention this last time. But since you were only there for a day, maybe think about some of the longer times that you've been there for. So what would be a typical day like? R:\tBasically you get up at like 3 in the morning. You eat breakfast. 3:30 in the morning, you eat breakfast. Pill call. Then after that, you can pretty much go to sleep, chill, pod time. Pod time is you can make phone calls, take a shower. You can go mingle with people, talk, play games. Then afterward, you know, everyone goes back in their cells if they have a cell, or back in their dormitory, cages, if they have a dormitory-style setting. Then afterward, it's dinner at 3:00. And, you know, you get mail after dinner time. And then after that's done, you know, just pretty much if you have commissary, you can make a little dessert afterward. And if not, then everyone's lights are out usually by like 10:00, 11:00. But there's those people that stay up all night. It's loud in jail, no matter what. There's people who sleep all the time, and then there's people who are just continuously loud. There's no in-between. I:\tWhat do you think was your biggest challenge on a day-to-day basis when you were there? R:\tUmm, eating because the food there is so bad [laugh]. It's literally soy bologna, disgusting stuff. The beans have real rocks in them, so you have to literally wash your beans out. Because if you eat the beans and you don't wash them out, you're going to break your tooth. Stuff like that. So it just sucks. I:\tThat's a trend. People have been saying that the food there is just terrible. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tWere there any informal rules for behavior that you lived by, rules for managing conflicts with people or with the guards and stuff? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Basically just, you know, don't step on anyone's toes. Respect another's personal space. You'll be good. I:\tWhat about talking to the guards or the people that work there? R:\tUmm, it depends. You know? If you're in a general population setting and you're doing that, they're going to think you're a snitch. Straight up. It sucks, but that's all there is to it. You just don't talk to the deputies like that. I:\tLike at all? R:\tI mean, if you're going to have a small talk real quick to, you know, ask about how to do a certain something, cool. But as far as having a full-ledge conversation, no. I:\tDo you feel like if you ask them things like what was going to happen or how long you'd be there for that they'd give you real answers to those questions? R:\tNo. Nope. I:\tYou just didn't even bother to ask because you knew? R:\tHmm, yeah. I:\tOkay. Were there any responsibilities or obligations that you couldn't fulfill because of your time in detention? R:\tNo. I:\tNo arrangements that you had to make in terms of work or anything like that? R:\tNo, no. No. Uh-uh. Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm like, \"No.\" I'd always make sure that I would take work off in advance and stuff. I wouldn't try to do anything spur-of-the-moment usually. Or I'd at least switch with somebody so I can get a specific day off and they would work that day. So I would have to put the day off. I:\tOkay. Were there any services that were available to you while you were there? So like educational programs, mental health, medical or dental? Anything like that? R:\tHmm, in jail? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tYes. I:\tDid you take advantage of any of them? R:\tHmm, they always make everybody in jail at first get a checkup and stuff. So that's pretty much all I know. I:\tOkay. So you didn't really take advantage of too many programs? R:\tNo. I wasn't there like  I wasn't trying to do stuff like that all the time because I was just like  I don't know. I just hated being in jail. I:\tWere there any services that weren't offered that you would have used had they been available? R:\tHmm, not that I know of. I:\tDid you keep in contact with family and friends? R:\tUh, my aunt and my best friend. And that's pretty much it. And my boyfriend. I:\tHow did they react to the news that you were there? R:\tUmm, my boyfriend  he was sad. He cried [laugh]. Yeah. And that's pretty much it. I:\tDid he come and visit you a lot? R:\tUh, he couldn't visit me because he's a felon. When you're a felon, you're not allowed to visit other people in jail. I:\tI didn't know that. Is he still in jail? You said he got arrested last night. R:\tHe got arrested last night. Yeah, he'll be in there for about a week because he had a warrant in a different county that he was supposed to take care of. But it was for petty theft. So it's like if they don't release him right then and there when he gets there, he'll be released within a week for sure. I:\tOkay. On his own recognizance? R:\tNo. After  it was just like a violation of probation. I:\tOkay. So while you were detained, were there things that made it difficult to keep in touch with family and friends? Actually, here's a list. R:\tSorry, it was a long day today. I:\tThat's okay. I know. I'll try to move it along a little bit, too. R:\tThat's okay. [Interruption] Oh, that's okay. No worries. The phone. Phone time. Phone calls to   I:\tLimited times that you could use the phone? R:\tPhone calls are too expensive. I:\tOh, okay. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Umm, and visitation rules. I:\tOkay. So you said you were released on bail. Was that before a decision on your case was made? R:\tUh, yeah. I:\tIt sounds like you had to go back today. R:\tI had to go back, yeah, literally. And I have had to been going back since last year. I:\tYeah? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tJust a ton of different court dates? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. What was your bail set at? R:\t$100,000. I:\tOkay. And how did you pay for your release? R:\tUmm, my aunt, and my mom, and my boyfriend all had to cosign on it. Oh, that's my boyfriend calling right now, too. Hold on, let me just  I:\tI'll put this on pause. R:\tIt's really just degrading in there. Really degrading. It's like literally you have to beg sometimes to get a roll of toilet paper or just, you know, drinking water. You're not going to get nothing to eat or drink in there at all. Like I said, they only give you food between 3 and 3. I mean, they'll give you lunch sometimes, but that's if you're lucky. I:\tSo I'm going to kind of move it through here because I know you've got stuff, and you're tired, and it's been a long day. R:\tI know. I:\tSo I'm going to skip over some stuff. But what sort of negative consequences did you experience as a result of being held in pretrial detention? R:\tUmm, like in jail? I:\tYeah. Did you lose a job, lose housing, lose a car? R:\tNo. Thank god that I didn't lose a job during the time back then. I was kind of homeless at the time anyways. So if anything, I just lost material things. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. So lost property? R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd then did you go into debt at all? R:\tUmm, no. I:\tOkay. Let's see. Did anything good come from detention? R:\tYeah. They actually  once I completed the program and the classes and whatnot, and they said once I pay the restitution off, then the felony will be dismissed. So it won't be brought down to a misdemeanor, it'll just be completely dismissed, which is really nice because then it won't be on my record anymore. I:\tRight. Okay. So then this section is about the process by which you were assessed for a diversion program that you participated in. So did you participate in pretrial diversion? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay. And it's different from the other thing? R:\tIt's different from supervised pretrial release, yeah. It's still in the same type of program. You still have to go through pretrial. But it's basically for those who have been in trouble more than once, and it's for serious felonies. I:\tOkay. Did they tell you about how you were being considered for that? R:\tYeah. Basically because I was a first-time offender in that county. I:\tDid your lawyer let you know? R:\tNo. They usually have jail clearance stuff from pretrial come to the jail, interview you. And based upon that, then they let you know, \"Okay, you're going to be released on your own recognizance, and you're going to be released under the pretrial diversion program.\" I:\tOkay. Did you have access to the council, like a lawyer or public defender? R:\tThey do appoint you one, yeah. I:\tOkay. So you had a public defender? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tDo you feel like they were useful or helpful? R:\tUmm, a little bit. I:\tThey were able to help you make sense of all your options? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay. Did they do an interview to determine if you were eligible? R:\tYes. That's what the jail clearance staff does. I:\tOkay. How did that process go? R:\tThey just basically asked me a couple of questions. And the main thing is you have to have an address that they can confirm with somebody. They have to talk to somebody basically to confirm that you will be able to go to that address and that house. Because if you're homeless or anything, then they'll just keep you in jail. So that's very, very important. If you don't have an address or if you don't have a place that they can confirm that you are going to go out to, be released to, then they won't release you. I:\tOkay. Did you feel like you had a choice in the matter? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tWere you able to choose to participate as opposed to any other options? R:\tUmm, I didn't even know about it until they came to me. So I mean, basically they had told me about it and I was like, \"Okay, cool.\" I:\tOkay. So it wasn't like, \"You can do this or you can do that\"? R:\tNo. \"Here it is.\" Yeah; here's diversion, pretty much. I:\tOkay. Were you ever assigned a level of risk, like risk for reoffending or anything like that? R:\tUmm, they just told me that if I reoffend then the diversion is no more and then I'll end up getting the felony. I:\tOkay. So they didn't give you a level or anything? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Were you ever made aware of an assessment about your needs? R:\tNeeds? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tLike some folks who go to diversion, they'll assess them for their needs as far as housing or mental health. R:\tOh, no. I:\tThere was no sort of assessment about that? R:\tNo. It just basically goes on the line of they want to make sure that you're not homeless and that you have a place to go to and stuff. Pretty much like that. I:\tHow much do you feel like the program helped you reduce your odds of reoffending? R:\tIt helps a lot because it really  during those classes and stuff, you talk to other people in there and you see other people's stories and whatnot. You know, and you see, \"I can either be there, or I can be here and not do it again and, you know, I don't have to worry about it anymore.\" I don't want to have to have that felony on my record. I mean, other people might view it as, \"Oh, it's whatever.\" But to me, it's like, \"A felony is a felony.\" It sucks because it really does hold you back from getting a lot of jobs and stuff like that. I:\tDo you feel like the classes that they ask you to do are useful or beneficial? R:\tUmm, some of them were, yeah. Hmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tWhich ones? R:\tIt's based on the facilitator because some facilitators are not more talkative, and some are. So like that. I:\tOkay. How much did it cost for you to participate? R:\tIt was free. Actually, no, it wasn't. It was $160.  I:\tOkay. Was it waived or reduced at all for low-income status? R:\tUmm, no. I:\tOkay. So what were the conditions of your participation? R:\tI had to do 12 weeks of classes. And then I had to check in once in person and once over the phone. That was required. I:\tPer week? R:\tPer week. I:\tOkay. And how long did it go total, how many months? R:\tUmm, well, I still check in now just because I'm in SPR. So I decided, \"Okay, if I'm still going to court for my pretrial diversion because of the restitution, I might as well check in still.\" So I check in for both. And basically it's just once in person and once over the phone. I:\tOkay. So the whole process was over a year of being in diversion then? R:\tUmm, I mean, it was like 12 weeks of classes. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. But in terms of checking in with somebody, that's still going on? R:\tI still do it just because of the SPR. Now, if I wasn't in SPR, I wouldn't be checking in. I:\tOkay. So diversion itself is really only 12 weeks then? R:\tThat's just how it was for me. It's different with everybody else. Some people are in diversion for months. Some people are in diversion for like a year. I:\tOkay. What kind of things did the program do to address your needs in terms of services, or counseling, or education, or anything like that? R:\tSay that one more time. I:\tWere there any programswhat did the program do in order to address your needs? R:\tBasically they made me aware of how it could affect me if I did get in trouble again, and what to do not to get into trouble. They give you all these resources and places that you can go to if you are bored and feel like you are going to offend again. You know, they give you all these places that you can hang out, and these workshops and whatnot that you can utilize there. San Francisco County was really good for that. I:\tOkay. And did you use any of those resources? R:\tUmm, yeah, I did in the beginning. Now, I don't because I don't use anymore. I:\tOkay. So you mentioned that you had to check in with somebody. Did you get along with that person, or was it the same person every time? R:\tIt's different people. I:\tOh, okay. R:\tYeah, different staff members. It's usually the jail clearance staff that usually works in there as well. They go in between there in the facility, in the building, and then also in the jail. But everyone was really cool. I:\tYeah. Okay. Were there any benefits to participation? R:\tNo. I:\tOther than not having the record? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. Any negative consequences associated with participating? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. Did you get to know any other program participants? R:\tYes, I did but only group-wise. I never got to befriend one or anything like that. You know, we're all there for a reason, and I just feel like  you know, I just don't want to have to  I don't know how people are going to be, like if they're seriously wanting to quit the mischief in their life, because I want to. You know, I wanted to, so I don't want to have to be around anything like that. You know? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tSome people are not done, or they don't learn. You know? And I'm the type of person that's like, \"I've learned my lesson. I don't want to go back.\" So pretty much like that. I:\tOkay. Were there any staff that you interacted with the most? R:\tUmm, yes. I actually  one of the directors or one of the main people therehis name is [Name]. He's really cool. He's helped me throughout the whole entire program. He always makes sure that I know my court dates, I know that I get my restitution payments in. He's pretty much making sure that I get good court reports and stuff like that for the judge. So stuff like that. I:\tOkay. Was it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tNo. Only, I mean, right now just because I have a full-time job. So it makes it a little bit hard to do a check in out there. But I'm at the point where I'm showing them my paystubs and stuff like that and my availability so they can actually see that, and that I can, you know change my in-person check ins to more phone check ins. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And they've been working with you and helping you to work around your schedule and stuff? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. Were you ever accused of violating the program requirements? R:\tNo. I don't think. No. I:\tWere they really clear with you about what would happen if you did, and if there was a process to argue that? R:\tUmm, basically, from what I remember, is that if you fail diversion, then you get the felony on your record. I:\tOkay. Were you told what you'd need to do in order to complete the program successfully? R:\tYes. I:\tWere you able to meet those obligations? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay. So has the program officially ended, or not really because you're still doing the supervised ? R:\tI'm still doing the supervised pretrial release. But as far as me not paying the restitution for the pretrial diversion, once I pay that off, then the pretrial diversion goes away. But since I haven't paid it off yet, it's still active. I:\tOkay. Did they tell you how it would happen when it ends? Are you going to have to go back to court and stuff? R:\tNo, they're just going to give me I think a letter in the mail or some shit like that. I'm pretty sure, yeah. I:\tOkay. What do you say to: \"Overall, the program was very helpful\"? Strongly agree to strongly disagree. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tOkay. What was the most helpful part about it? R:\tUh, just basically being able toI don't know, express yourself and stuff. And you're not going to get judged for it. You know, it's just creating a plan to better yourself and whatnot. So it was really nice to be able to talk and be able to have good input from it, too. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. You got good advice from other people? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. Would you recommend it to others? R:\tYes. I:\tAre there any issues that you think require addressing just in terms of how the program treats its clients and addresses their needs? R:\tSay that one more time. I:\tSure. Are there any issues that you think require addressing just in terms of how the program treats its clients and addresses their needs? R:\tI think they've been doing a hell of a good job. I:\tAnd did it prepare you to deal with any challenges once your program ended? R:\tHmm, no.  I:\tWas it the diversion program that hooked you up with treatment this last time? R:\tUmm, no. I:\tYou were already on methadone doing that? Did they give you your doses while you were in jail? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay, so this next set of questions is about your immediate experiences after your most recent release. So can you tell me about the day you were released, walk me through it step by step? R:\tYes. I was released. You're talking about the last time? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tUmm, which was basically the SPR case. I was released right after bail. The next daywell, almost the next dayit was like 13 hours later and I was released at like five minutes, seven minutes before the BART closed on a rainy night. So I had to literally run to my death to the BART just to catch the train. It was horrible. But, Umm, yeah, that's pretty much it. I:\tBut you made it?  R:\tYeah, I made it. Sorry, I'm so tired right now. I:\tThat's okay. And I'm trying to move through a little quicker. R:\tI know. I'm likeugg, I'm so tired. I've been up since like 5:00. I:\tOh, I'm so sorry. R:\tThat's okay. I know you wanted to do this. I'm like, \"I want to do this for you, too.\"  I:\tI really appreciate it. R:\tYeah, I know. My sister used to do studies and stuff like that, too. So I know how important it was to her and the class and whatnot.  I:\tFor sure. But, I promise, I'm trying to hurry. R:\tDo you know how much longer? I:\tThere are two more blocks after this. They're going to go quicker because we've already talked about some of it. R:\tOkay. I:\tSo tell me a little bit about the first month after your release. R:\tUmm, I stayed indoors every day. I didn't go out once. I was scared. I:\tOf what? R:\tJust scared. I just felt horrible about the people. I just felt bad. I was getting, literally, anxiety. I:\tHow did you overcome that? R:\tJust through time. Time is the healer of everything. So basically that. I:\tAnd how did you support yourself financially that first month out? Were you working? R:\tHmm, yeah, I was working at [place]. I:\tOkay. Okay, so I'm going to go through this list kind of fast. Are there any programs that you had access to for finding a place to live? R:\tUh, yes. I:\tDid you use it? R:\tUmm, my boyfriend did. I:\tWas it helpful? R:\tYes. I:\tIn finding a job? R:\tUh, yes. I:\tDid you use it? R:\tYes. I:\tWas it helpful? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay. How about finding a means of transportation? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tLike any programs available to you that helped you find out how to get from place to place. R:\tHmm, no. I:\tNo? Okay. How about continuing your education? R:\tYes. I:\tDid you use it? R:\tNo. I:\tFinding legal assistance? R:\tUh, wait, what was the question? I:\tDid you have access to any kind of programs for finding legal assistance? R:\tOh, no. I:\tDrug and alcohol treatment? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tNo? What you were doing was totally independent of the program? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tSo the question is: \"Did you have access to a program for getting drug or alcohol treatment?\" And you were in a program? R:\tNo. See, the methadone program is like a program and it's like a rehabilitation. So it's kind of like both I guess. It's like self-help and a program I guess. But it's not like a rehab, though. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. It's not like a program that you accessed, it's just something to ? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. Accessing healthcare? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tWere there any programs that you accessed that helped you? R:\tJust Medi-Cal. I:\tOkay. Getting counseling? R:\tNo. I:\tFinancial assistance? R:\tUh, no. I:\tGetting photo ID? R:\tUmm, yeah, welfare. I:\tOkay. And you used that? R:\tYes. They have a discount where they can give you like a $10 fee instead of paying the $30. I:\tOkay. And anything about working on personal relationships? R:\tHmm, uh-uh [no]. I:\tOkay. Okay, we'll move through some of these. How did your detention affect your relationship with family members? Did your relationship change at all, or not much? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. What kind of support did they provide? Financial, housing, emotional, finding work, transportation, or none? R:\tHmm, say that one more time. I:\tSure. So what type of support did your family members provide you? None, financial, housing, emotional, finding work, transportation? R:\tHmm, none. I:\tNone? Okay. Other than your mom signing off on the bail? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo kind of like financial, or is she paying that? R:\tNo, I pay it. I:\tYou just have to pay her back, kind of thing? R:\tMy aunt mostly, yeah. My mom didn't really throw down nothing. Well, when you work for a school district and stuff like that, you get like $2,000 off. So instead of paying $10,000, I would pay $8,000. And my aunt is the one that put down everything mostly. So I have to pay her back. I:\tOkay. Did your detention affect your relationship with your friends at all, or not much? R:\tNo, uh-uh [no]. I:\tI mean, other than the friend that was in the car with you? R:\tYeah, we're not friends anymore at all. At all. I:\tOkay. Just because of how she reacted? R:\tThat, and just you don't have to snitch on me when, you know, I already told you I was going to take the fall for it. I would never let  you know, I told her, \"I would never put you under the bus like that.\" You know, I'm the one in the driver's seat. I do take responsibility of my actions. I am an adult. I'm not just some little kid. I:\tOkay. So the next block is about housing. How many places did you live following your most recent release? R:\tUh, two. I:\tOkay. And what was your living situation immediately following your release? R:\tUmm, to my aunt's house. I:\tYou were living with a family member? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tAnd what were the pros and cons of that living situation? R:\tHmm, just waking up all early. I like to stay up late when I can. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. And what's your housing situation like today? Is this your aunt's house? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. So are the pros and cons the same? You just got to keep on their schedule, kind of thing? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. And have you ever had trouble finding a place to live because of your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tHmm, no. I:\tOkay. You mentioned earlier that you were homeless for a while. R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat was that like? R:\tThat was because of drugs. I:\tWere you in the city? R:\tNo, I was living out here in the East Bay. I was living in my car for like a year [laugh]. It sucked. Yeah. I:\tHow did you move from doing that? R:\tWhat do you mean? How did that happen? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tI got kicked out. We got kicked out of his mom's house. And then we just  you know, nobody wants people that are, you know, using drugs. You know, especially back then when we were using needles and stuff. So nobody wants that happening. So basically it was like that. So we just kind of secluded ourselves afterwards, too, because we didn't want to be around anyone after a while. I:\tOkay. So this next set is, again, strongly agree to strongly disagree. So immediately following your most recent release, what would you say to: \"In my first month out, I felt like my neighborhood was a safe place to live\"? R:\tHmm, true. I:\tAgree? R:\tYeah, agree. I:\tOkay. \"In my first month out, it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood.\" R:\tDisagree. I:\t\"In my first month out, I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood.\" R:\tNo, disagree. I:\t\"Drug-selling was a major problem in my neighborhood.\" R:\tAgree. I:\t\"I think my neighborhood was a good place to live.\" R:\tCan you say that one more time? I:\t\"I think my neighborhood was a good place to live.\" R:\tHmm, maybe. I:\tThere's a \"neither agree nor disagree\". R:\tNeither, yeah. We just had a murder not even two weeks ago right around the corner from my house. And then we had a drive-by shooting in front of my house. I:\tSeriously? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo disagree for \"My neighborhood is a good place to live,\" then? Okay. \"I care about what my neighbors think of my actions.\" R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tAgree. No, just regular. I:\tOkay. \"If there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who live there could get it solved.\" R:\tUh, most of the time. Agree. I:\tOkay. \"I expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time.\" R:\tAgree. I:\tOkay. So same kind of thing, only now this is about your neighborhood today. \"My neighborhood is a safe place to live.\" R:\tDisagree [laugh]. I:\t\"It's hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood.\" R:\tUh, \"It's hard to stay of out trouble.\" Disagree. I:\t\"I'm nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood.\" R:\tDisagree. No, I don't feel nervous about that. I:\tOkay. \"Drug-selling is a major problem in my neighborhood.\" R:\tTrue. Agree. I:\t\"I think my neighborhood is a good place to live.\" R:\tHmm, I agree, somewhat. It just depends on where you're at, in what area. I:\tOkay. \"I care about what my neighbors think of my actions.\" R:\tAgree. I:\t\"If there's a problem in my neighborhood, I can get it solved, or people who live here can get it solved.\" R:\tHmm, agree. I:\t\"I expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time.\" R:\tAgree. I:\tOkay. What are your goals in terms of housing, your future goals? R:\tHmm, I don't know. Say that one more time. Sorry. I:\tSure. What are your goals in the future for housing? R:\tUmm, I've just got to save up and make sure everything is paid on time and whatnot. You know, basically establish myself. I:\tYou hope to get your own place? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. But right here in Hayward? R:\tUmm, yeah, it's cheaper right now. I would like to go back to Fremont, but it's just too expensive. Way too expensive. I:\tOkay. And then this is the last block, so we're almost done, and it's about employment. So following your immediate release, you said you worked at [place]? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. And what was your job title? You were server? R:\tServer. I:\tWhen did you start that job? R:\tUmm, I started that in January of 2014. I:\tWas it full-time? R:\tPretty much, yes. I:\tOkay. And how did you find that job? R:\tUmm, I applied. I:\tOkay. How much money did you earn there? R:\tUmm, like every day was at least $200. I:\t$200 per day. [Inaudible 118:54] per week then. Let's do that. Okay. And you quit that job? R:\tYes, I had to because I was starting to commute. I didn't want to lose the job, so I decided to quit. I:\tOkay. When did it end? R:\tUmm, that ended in July of  I don't know. Sorry, I'm super freaking out of it right now. I:\tThat's okay. R:\tI'm like super tired right now. I:\tWe're almost done. R:\tOkay, you have to repeat that one more time. I'm just so out of it today. I:\tOkay. When did that job end? R:\tUmm, that ended in October 2014  or 2015. I:\tOkay. Let's see. R:\tYou're tired, huh, baby? I:\tHe's sleepy, too. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tDid you ever have to search for work for long periods of time? R:\tNo, I get jobs very quick. I:\tOkay. R:\tI'm about to go straight to bed as soon as you leave [laugh]. I've been so tired. I was falling asleep in the courtroom today, too. I felt so bad. I:\tSerious? You needed to wait there a long time, too. R:\tI had to be there all day. It was so horrible. I:\tWhat would you say to this one: \"Having a criminal record has made it difficult for me to find work\"? R:\tNot really just because I know where to find jobs that accept felons, and that they don't trip too much about that kind of stuff. So  so far  I:\tSo somewhat disagree? R:\tUmm, just disagree. I:\tOkay. Just because the type of work you're looking for? R:\tYeah. I:\tOkay. Where do you see yourself in terms of employment in the next five years? R:\tUmm, hopefully somewhere in some type of law enforcement. Even though it may not be like that, but you can still do other things that  I just found out working with the Coroner's Bureau and stuff, you don't need to be, you know, involved with police work and stuff like that. But you can do forensics stuff and whatnot, and that doesn't have to involve getting into that type of stuff where you for sure don't have to  you know? Basically, I talked to a deputy before and he told me that you can be in the Coroner's Bureau and still have a felony. I:\tOkay. So you want to do kind of civil ? R:\tStuff like that, yeah. I:\tCriminal justice kind of work? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tOkay. Very cool. You said you didn't incur any debt because of your contact with the criminal justice system, right? R:\tNo. Well, what do you mean? Like restitution? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Yeah, things you have to pay. R:\tYeah, I have a restitution to pay off from the felony that I'm going through right now, but I don't know what it is yet. They said it's probably going to be roughly around $50,000. I:\t$50,000? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tWow. So do you know how much you're going to have to pay per month? R:\tI don't know. I:\tOkay. Wow, that's a lot. Okay. Any fines, specific fines? Nothing like that? Court fees? R:\tUh-uh [no]. No, I qualify for the public defender, so I don't get any fees for that. I:\tOkay. Any parole or probation fees? R:\tUh, no. I:\tHas the debt that you've had to pay ever make you have to go back to court or be re-incarcerated? R:\tNo. I:\tYou ever have your wages garnished? R:\tI have before, yes. I:\tOkay. Because of that, the restitution? R:\tUh, no. I:\tOkay. Did it affect your credit score at all? R:\tUh, I'm pretty sure it has. I don't try to look at that too much just because it makes me sad. I seen it once and I was likeokay, I'm not going to do it for a while [laugh]. I:\tYeah. Okay. So in general, how would you say your criminal justice obligations have affected your life? R:\tHmm, somewhat. You know what I'm saying? Just somewhat. I don't know, it's affected it somewhat I guess. I don't know. What do you mean? I:\tIt's actually one of the last questions. So just wrapping it all up, how has your life been affected by this kind of thing? R:\tIt's been affected to where I have clearly understood what I've done, and I don't want to go back to doing that kind of stuff or even repeat it again just because it's like going through the court dates, taking the time off work, getting up earlier than I need to. It all affects everything because there's only so much hours in a day. And it's like if I want to, you know, make money and pay my bills, and pay restitution and do everything, I need to work. And taking so much time off of work and everything really affects you in the long run. You know? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tSo it's like you have to really improvise on your time. And then at the end of the day, I'm like this at not even 10:00. You know, I'm popped. So a lot of long, long, long days come from it afterward. And that's what it comes from, just a long day. And it makes you very exhausted and doesn't give you the time to do other things that you want to because you have to focus on this. So I found out I'm getting an ankle monitor and I have to be on house arrest for six months. I:\tOh, really? R:\tYeah. So I'll be getting an ankle monitor in September. I:\tDo they let you go to work when you have that? R:\tYeah. So I'll be able to go to work only and come home. That's it. I:\tOkay. Did they make a decision about your driving? Are you still not allowed to drive? R:\tI'm still not allowed to drive right now, but I'll find out what the final say will be in September. I:\tOh, okay. So up until September, you can't drive at all? R:\tWell, I can't drive around. I have a suspended license. So I mean, even if I did pay off the suspended license, you know, I don't know if they're going to take it away for a certain number of years. I:\tDid they make it sound like that was a real possibility? R:\tIt's going to be. Hmm-hmm [yes]. I just don't know how long. I:\tOkay. Is there anything else important in your life right now that's going on that we haven't talked about? R:\tNo, I think that's pretty much it. I:\tThat's a lot. So your boyfriend, you say maybe a week he'll be out? R:\tMaybe like a week or two just because he's on probation right now. So I don't know if they're going to violate his probation or not. But he has two misdemeanors. So usually for that, you know, they'll want to not make you be in jail for such a long time. Come here, baby. I:\tOkay. Do you have any questions for me? R:\tNo. You've been awesome. I:\tOh, thank you. So some of the things we've talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable. Were there any topics that were particularly uncomfortable? Nothing? [Inaudible 126:06] we could ask any of our questions more effectively? R:\tNo. I:\tOkay. So this next part asks if you would be willing to give us contact information for family or friends in case we need to get back in touch with you. Is that something you're willing to do? R:\tWhat do you mean? I:\tIn case we ever needed to get back in touch with you and we couldn't. R:\tYeah. I:\tAnd you don't have to do all three either. R:\tOkay. I:\tUnless you want to. R:\tI'm so tired. I'm going to crash out. Thank you. I:\tSo this is for you. R:\tAw. I told you I feel so bad. Aw. I:\tDon't. That's what we're doing this for. R:\tThank you. I:\tAnd this is just a receipt that you received that. R:\tAll right. And then you want me to sign where? I:\tSo if you print your name here and then sign there, then I'll do the rest at home. My printer doesn't actually print out the lines. I don't really know why that is. R:\tYou have to reformat it maybe. I don't know. I:\tYeah, I think they're gray or something maybe. I'm not super sure. I'm going to actually turn this off. [End of audio 127:42]  End of SF310    SF187\t\tPage 53  \n",
      " I:\tSo theres a copy of our consent to participate. So, take as much time as you need to read over that. R:\tCool. All right, yeah, that sounds great. I:\tSo if you could just sign here. And Ive got a copy that you can keep, too. R:\tVery well. I:\tSo thats for you. So, first Im just going to start by asking you some questions about your background. How old are you? R:\tI am 26 years old. I:\tAnd whats your birthday? R:\t09/10/1989. I:\tSo you have a birthday coming up. R:\tYes. I:\tAnd where were you born? R:\tLima, Peru. I:\tAre you a US citizen? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd race or ethnicity? R:\tLatino. I:\tAnd is that how others perceive your race? R:\tSure. I:\tPresent marital status? R:\tSingle. I:\tNever married? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you have any kids? R:\tNo. I:\tHighest level of education youve completed? R:\tCollege. I:\tYour bachelors? R:\tYes, bachelors. I:\tAnd did you receive any help in school with academics, like tutoring, reading or math help, special ed, counseling? R:\tTutoring. I:\tFor anything specific, or just to help out a little bit? R:\tGeneral. I:\tAnd how do you support yourself financially? R:\tFreelancing; independent contractor. I:\tHow much do you make doing that? R:\t$700 a month. I:\tSo then your total household income per year? R:\tIts pretty low. Its about $15,000 a year. I:\tSo now Im going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationships with your family. So, family would mean blood or legal relatives, or significant others, or guardians that youve lived with. So, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, what would you say for, I feel close to my family? R:\tI agree. I:\tI want my family to be involved in my life. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tI consider myself a source of support for my family. R:\tDisagree. I:\tMy family is a source of support for me. R:\tAgree. I:\tI fight a lot with my family members. R:\tAgree. I:\tI often feel like I disappoint my family. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tIm criticized a lot by my family. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd when you say family, are you talking your parents and siblings? R:\tIts how it defines it there. I:\tAre they here in the Bay Area? R:\tTheyre around. I:\tSome of them, maybe? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tSo the same kind of thing. I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk. R:\tI agree. I:\tAnd how many people in your family would you say you can do that with? R:\tOne. I:\tI have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide advice on finding a place to live. R:\tAgree. I:\tThe same one person? R:\tYep. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem. R:\tI agree. I:\tOne person again? I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if I needed it. R:\tNot applicable. I live close enough that I dont need it. I:\tI have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support. R:\tId say agree. Ive never asked for it, but Id say agree. I:\t[Inaudible 07:04]. R:\tI suppose. I:\tIs it just one person? So family and friends can be important sources of support, but they can also sometimes be a source of stress. So, can you describe some relationships that you have with your family that are really supportive or really stressful? R:\tI dont know. I would say stressful in professional acceptance, but thats pretty much it. Everything else is really good. I:\tSo they dont like the work that you do? R:\tThey dont understand the work that I do. I:\tWhat kind of supportive relationships do you have with them? R:\tI mean, socially and emotionally supportive, kind, caring, warm household. But its just the professional thing is difficult. I:\tDo you see them often? R:\tOnce a week. I:\tA set schedule once a week?- R:\tYeah. I:\tIs there a reason that its a set, once-a-week thing? R:\tConvenience. I:\tSo the next set of questions is about relationships with people outside your family. So, can you think of three people that you feel closest to personally, like friends? Doesnt include family or a romantic partner. Are there three people that you are closest to? R:\tSure, yeah. I:\tSo for the third friend, is this person male or female? R:\tId say male. I:\tWhats his race or ethnicity? R:\tWhite. I:\tAge? R:\tHes 26. I:\tAnd whats the highest level of education he completed? R:\tBachelors degree. I:\tIs he working for pay? R:\tYep. I:\tIs he receiving any kind of public aid? R:\tNope. I:\tAnd is he married or living with a partner? R:\tWell, hes living with his roommate, but theyre not gay. I:\tSo no. R:\tYeah. I:\tFor the second friend, male or female? R:\tFemale. I:\tAnd her race or ethnicity? R:\tAsian, I guess. I:\tAnd her age? R:\tI think shes 21. I:\tThe highest level of education she completed? R:\tBA. I:\tIs she working for pay? R:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I:\tReceiving any kind of public aid? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd married or living with a partner? R:\tLiving in an apartment with people. I:\tNot a significant other, though? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd then for your first friend, male or female? R:\tMale. I:\tEthnicity? R:\tLatino. I:\tAge? R:\t26. I:\tHighest level of education? R:\tBA. I:\tWorking for pay? R:\tYes. I:\tReceiving public aid? R:\tNo. I:\tAnd married or living with a partner? R:\tLives in an apartment with other people. I:\tSo now Im going to ask you some questions about organizations or groups you may be a part of, and if you receive any emotional or material support from them. So, do you belong to a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious organization? R:\tNo. I:\tRecreational club? Sports team? Music or artist group? How often do you participate in that? R:\tOnce a week. I:\tCould you turn to that group for emotional support? R:\tSure, yeah. I:\tHow about material support? R:\tNo. I:\tDo you play in a band? R:\tJust go to a space. I:\tTo listen to a group? Okay. Crew or a gang? R:\tNo. I:\tLocal government? Civic association? Support group of any kind? So, now Im going to ask some questions about your employment history. So, how old were you when you had your first job? R:\t15. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life would you say that youve been employed for? R:\tSince that point on, pretty much--well, I mean, outside of school--and even in school, for a good amount of it. Well, I mean, are you talking about summer employment or just generally employed? I:\tI think just generally, but you dont have to count when you were in school or anything. R:\tYeah, probably since 16. Pretty much, yeah--15 on. I:\tWhat kind of skills do you bring to the labor market? R:\tIm kind of creative consulting, in a sense. I did a lot of promotion and video marketing, digital marketing. So, thats what I did. I:\tYou dont do that anymore? R:\tI do, but--yeah. I:\tOn a freelance basis? R:\tYeah. I:\tWhat is it that your family doesnt like about that? R:\tI wouldnt know. I:\tThey just said that they dont like it? R:\tIts not they dont like it; they dont understand. I:\tThey wanted you to be something else, or do something else with your room? Is that what you did your bachelors in? R:\tIn a sense, yeah. I graduated from Occidental College with a BA in film and media studies. I:\tAnd are you doing what you wanted to do with that, or was it kind of you just were interested in film and media, and  R:\tIts not to say that Im not doing it, but its also not to say that I am. Im working with other entrepreneurs and individuals to do more media-based promotion and products for them. So, I mean, kind of yeah--more yeah than no. So, Im not one of those guys who got a degree, and isnt doing anything related to it. I:\tAre there any skills that youre trying to learn, or that you hope to learn in the future? R:\tSocial media marketing, grassroots organizing, civic engagement skills, public speaking/oration, yeah. I:\tThings like that? R:\tYeah. I:\tCan you talk about the grassroots organizing? What kind of causes are you thinking about? R:\tI mean, just to have a good time. I think that people think that grassroots organizing has to be something driven by an agenda, and I think thats not the greatest way to get peoples attention. I grew up here. And so I saw that grassroots organizing is just the new religion. Its like, you better believe this political ideology or else--or else youre a Nazi, or a racist, or youre whatever. And its super stupid. So, I decided that I wanted to do organizing simply around a music and dance party. A lot of people get an inner peace from that. And you can go to rallies, and its all about, oh, us versus them; F the whatever. And, you know, XYZ hashtag is chicken shit. So, I was like, thats not getting anybody anywhere, really, you know. They may have some minor victories, in terms of the vocabulary of it, but its really not getting us too far anywhere, you know. People are still killing people. People who look like each other still kill people who look just like them. Its not really working out too well. You know what I mean? My homegirl just told me the Earth has only one billion years left to go. In the grand scheme of things, I mean, thats a whole lot of time, but thats not the human race; thats the Earth. The sun is going to get too big in a billion years. The Earth is six billion years old. Weve spent 6/7 pretty much of our survival time up. And humans might not even make it another 1,000 years. So, what can we do? The cause for me is about being--we need to understand that we should be taking this time to make our world better in the most simple ways possible. You know what I mean? So, all this standing up here on the corner, talking about Greenpeace and shit--okay, I get that whales are out there, and that all these amazing things are happening, but humans can barely perceive of the universe beyond what their five senses can understand, right? If I told you that all that crazy stuff thats going on in the world with the cops and whatever, thats all fake--theres no way that thats real. All that stuff is doctored. All that whatever is all put together. Theres no way for you to prove that its not happening. It could, you know, all be a hoax. Anything could all be a hoax, really. Donald Trump--it could just be a reality show stunt. So, what does Donald Trump have to do with me and Berkeley? That guy cant touch me here, but his ideas can. And thats what I want to try to--with the dance party, youre dancing with people of other ethnicities, other musics on, people dancing, doing their own weird types of dance, and you come together. And then from then, you can start having that discussion about politics, because youve had that intimate connection, person-to-person connection, not verbal. You know what I mean? Not even culture--just a human experience. And then from then on, you can start to talk about the greater things. You know what I mean? So, thats what Im talking about with organizing and grassroots and social media marketing. My goal is to do these little dance parties, and art parties, and musical jams outside of City Hall, before the City Council meetings go on, because, you know, I mean, I bet you dollars people on Cal campus dont even know who represents them in City Council. You know what I mean? The fact that--anyway, but I decided that thats where I want to be, and thats what I want to use what Im doing to get to. So, thats what Im saying--Im not there yet, but Im not not there, you know. I:\tIts a process. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo heres a list. Are there any things on this list that have been a barrier for employment for you? R:\tWow, now that you put it like that  I:\tI mean, and theres a, you know, option for none of it. R:\tI would just say no barriers. Yeah, that puts it in perspective. But  I:\tSo how many jobs do you currently hold? R:\tZero. Well, technically, two jobs. So, freelancing and then Im an on-call technical assistant. But thats very infrequent. Its not something that I can really say I rely on as a means of income. I:\tSo for your current job, are we just calling it freelance? R:\tYeah, freelance. I:\tWhen did you start doing that job? R:\tI mean, Ive been freelancing pretty much my entire career. So, Id say May 2011. I:\tAnd do you consider it fulltime? R:\tI try. I mean, I try to put in eight hours a day of work towards my thing. I should do more. I:\tHow did you get started doing that? R:\tI had an experience within the field that I was working in that wasnt positive, but at the same time, I realized that I could be doing it by myself. So, I kind of just became specialized enough that I could put myself out there in that way. I:\tSo I dont know if any of these are going to be relevant then, right? Sounds like other would be the most appropriate. R:\tYeah. I:\tYou said $700 a month? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo the freelancing and the technical stuff--is this typical of the kinds of jobs youve had in the past? R:\tNo, not really. Well, I mean, you know, even though its been a constant, my bread and butter has kind of been retail/administrative assistants. So, thats kind of my bread and butter for most of it. I:\tSo in your earlier years, you were retail and  R:\tYeah, I was a front desk clerk. I:\tSo this one says, describe your experiences in the job market thus far. How has it been working out? R:\tRelatively successfully. I can say that I havent done enough in my life. But overall, successful, constant. Im able to get jobs. I:\tYou feel like youre moving towards your goals, it sounds like, and-- R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWhat was your most positive work experience ever? R:\tThe most positive work experience was working for a television show based out of Oakland, California. It was a lifestyle show where we went to a number of interesting locations, did interviews, shot footage. It was a production company comprised pretty much mostly people of color. The pay was interesting. The pay was good, I suppose. But yeah, no, that was probably my most positive experience, until it wasnt. But yeah. I:\tWhat was it that was positive about-- R:\tShe didnt pay me. I mean, just feeling that you and me, as a person of color, could be who I am, and still be a professional in this industry without having to really compromise a whole lot; being able to see great new places; going on trips to, you know, Northern California and stuff; and kind of living the rich peoples way of life for a little bit. But it wasnt a sustainable job. I:\tBecause she didnt pay you? R:\tShe didnt pay me, yeah. I:\tShe forgot? R:\tYeah. I mean, it was a whole dispute. And thats what I was going to say--is its also one of my most negative experiences, because it just also showed me--it was disheartening to find this woman who Id put up so high on a pedestal was basically just using me, and she really didnt have that next level, even though she continues talking about it. So, it was kind of back and forth. I learned a lot, but I also learned a lot what not to do. So, thats why it was one of my best experiences--I was always learning. I:\tSometimes our worst experiences are our best, right? R:\tYep. I:\tSo was that your most negative work experience, then? R:\tYeah, that, as well. Yeah. I:\tIs there anything more that you want to talk about in terms of work experience? R:\tNope. I:\tSo the following are questions about experiences you may have had with substance abuse, if any. Remember that all your answers are kept private. Have you ever had a drinking or a drug problem? R:\tAlcoholism. I:\tHow old were you when that started? R:\tTechnically, it always was. I would say 19, 20-ish. When I went abroad, thats when I really started getting ramped up. But 19 or 20, probably. I:\tHave you ever received treatment? R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tHow many times? R:\tEnough times. I:\tMore than once? R:\tYeah, a lot. I mean, I went through a program after, a little thingy. I:\tSo can you describe the effects that alcohol has had on your life?  R:\tJust a retardant, basically. It was a convenient substitute for boredom and not wanting to deal with whatever. And then I realized  I guess you could say vicious cycle or something like that. I:\tDo you still struggle with this today? R:\tNo. I:\tHow did you overcome it? Did you find treatment was helpful? R:\tTreatment was ignorant of some of the greater struggles that go on in my head. So, one thing that I noticed about treatment is, its very Abrahamically religiously centered. And so when I went to AA for the first time, it was very, very obviously--you know, its not explicit, but it aint hard to tell that it was a religious institution before, you know--talking about the higher power, this. And I found it hypocritical, you know. Its your body doing this to you; only your body can get out of it. Your neurons fire off to tell you to do this, to tell your muscle to do that, to tell your muscle to grab that drink. Theres nobody else. And so from day one, I had a big problem with it. But it worked--but only because I wanted to get the hell out of there. And the court mandated that I had to be there. So, I closed my mouth like a good boy, did what they said, and just got it done, you know. I mean, thats not to say that Im completely drug-free or whatever, but now I know what it does, you know. Im not going to be some little Puritan-type guy, because one thing that I learned about that whole recovery program is that most people are in there for two or three times. This isnt their first time. So, I thought if people are here for two or three times, thats like going to Weight Watchers, and then you go back and eat Mickey Ds and then come right back. Its not working. Something about it is not working. You know what I mean? I dont know what it is, but if youre coming back there--and there were people confessing in there, oh, you know--theyd be like, oh, I went back on the wagon. And theyre like, okay, well, we got to reset your days. And its like, okay, well, now this guys locked in here for another, you know, 60 hours or whatever--another 60 days. You know, thats 60 more days off work. Thats more stress on his life. What do you think hes going to do? Exactly what he just confessed about. Hes going to go to the little bar. You know, maybe he might drink some nonalcoholic beer. And then hes not feeling like that. So, you know, it didnt make sense to me. It was stupid, you know. It was just stupid. I:\tWas there really more about learning your limits, or making a decision? R:\tYeah, it was about making a decision that I dont want to live like this anymore. And, you know, making that decision that everybody on this planet has the choice to say die. And its at what degree you decide to say that. And I just realized, this was a path that I was just saying die every day. And it wasnt with some higher power, or some government official, or some police officer telling me. It was me being in that situation, like, I dont want to be here anymore. But if theres people who just want to be in that same situation 24 hours after the fact they just marinated on that, I cant help them. Im not going to help them. Im not Superman. You know what I mean? Even the greatest superhero isnt going to save you from yourself. Its just not going to happen. Even a superhero cant save himself all the time. Its up to them. You know what I mean? Within their struggles. So, the experience was twofold. It healed me in kind of an anti way. It was so stupid, it was so inane of an experience that I just wanted to get done with it just so I could be done with it, and prove that I was right. Thats what got me through. I wanted to be right. I didnt want to be healthy. I didnt want to be sober. I wanted to be right, you know. I:\tIt makes sense. R:\tYep. I:\tIs there anything else you want to add or talk more about in terms of that? R:\tNope. I:\tSo now Im going to ask you about mental and emotional health. Remember that all your answers are kept private. R:\tYep. I:\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, that you had a mental or emotional condition or showed symptoms of a mental or emotional condition? R:\tNot one thats clinically diagnosed. I mean, I was told in the heyday of the 90s that I was diagnosed as ADD, but everybody was. I mean, I wouldnt say chronic--Ive had insomnia for a while. Its slowly getting under control--but aggravated insomnia. But no, nothing out of the ordinary, really. I mean, you know, I cant think of really too much that I would say that they would--I mean, when I was put into jail for the first time, I was sent to the psychiatric ward, but I dont know if that was because of my behavior or just simply because it was an overcrowding issue or a, you know, drunk tank issue, you know. I:\tDo you agree with the ADD diagnosis? R:\tI dont know what ADD really means. I mean, ADD is essentially the reason that humans are able to do anything, really, you know. If humans arent able to multitask, we wouldnt go too far. So, ADD is just a convenient way of saying, your brain isnt just wired to one thing all day. I dont think any human is. Youre probably thinking about lunch right now, you know. If you were completely concerned on this, itd be a little bit frightening. But I can tell that your brain goes other places. I:\tYeah. R:\tSo thats what Im saying with the caveat. I dont know what ADD meant back then--whether they just said, oh, hes a hyperactive kid, and didnt know what to do with me; whether it was just some sort of implicit bias who knows? I mean, this is all way early in my childhood. Just told me, and I said, okay, sure. Why not? You know, they tell a kid hes gifted, and, shit, hell believe it for the rest of his life, even if hes dumb as a brick. But you tell a kid hes gifted, you know, you tell a kid hes stupid, hell believe it. He doesnt have to be.  I:\tSo do you think that there was a condition you ever had that wasnt diagnosed, then, or--does the insomnia make you think that? R:\tThink what? I:\tThat you might have a mental or emotional condition thats not been diagnosed. R:\tI dont think I would have one. I mean, I dont know. I dont think so. I mean, wonder would be the only thing--extraordinary wonder, I guess, but thats, you know, just any philosophers great struggle. But no, nothing super clinical or whatever. I:\tHave you ever thought you might have a learning disability or a processing issue that wasnt diagnosed? R:\tI mean, thats what Im saying under the ADD--you know, that word is so malleable. I mean, I do have trouble concentrating and stuff, but yeah, I cant think of anything. I:\tSo your school years, other than that one incident with ADD, was really typical? R:\tNo, but I couldnt say its extraordinarily different, you know. I wasnt the girl going to rehab in seventh grade. You know, it wasnt that. I:\tDid you like it, though? R:\tYeah. I mean, you know, the way any kid does. I:\tHave you ever taken medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of emotional or mental health? R:\tSee, and thats the other thing--I wasnt given the medication for mental health; it was for my sleeping. But it affected my mental health in a certain kind of way. So, I took Ritalin for a bit and then this other thing called trazodone, which is kind of a sleeping medication, but thats pretty much it--and Wellbutrin, but that was the same thing; just a lower dose. I:\tIm going to put yes, even though youre kind of giving it a caveat. Thatll be picked up by the transcript. So you said you were admitted to the psychiatric facility in jail, but youre unsure what conditions that was under. R:\tYeah. You know, some of the other people in there were getting pills and stuff, and I was just there. I mean, some of the people there didnt seem like they were insane or had any medical necessities. It seems like they were just put in there because overcrowding or whatever, you know. I dont know. I:\tAnd you think thats probably why you were there. R:\tMore likely than not, thats probably why I was there. I:\tWere you evaluated by anybody? R:\tI think everybody is evaluated, you know, on a walk-by basis by a couple of, you know, psychiatrists, just to see if youre 5150 or whatever. But I wasnt doing anything really out of the normal. If I were them looking at me, I wouldnt say that I necessitated psychiatric help. I:\tHave you ever received counseling or therapy? R:\tYes. I:\tIs that because of the insomnia? R:\tI dont know. I:\tYou dont remember, or was it when you were little? R:\tWhen I was little, yeah. I:\tDo you remember it being helpful? R:\tI dont remember. I:\tIt was just a long time ago? R:\tYep. I:\tI mean, did any of your family participate with you at all? You feel like you have an emotional or mental condition now? Okay. So, next, I want to learn about your interactions with the police. Approximately how many times have you been arrested? R:\tI think twice, technically. I:\tAnd for what offenses? R:\tActually, it was  yikes, none of these. It was for a trespassing, actually. It was a trespassing and drunk and disorderly beef. I:\tBoth times? R:\tOh, no, no, no. Trespassing/vandalism was one of them, and then the drunk and disorderly was another one. I:\tHow old were you at the time of your first arrest? R:\tSixteen. I:\tCan you describe the event, from the minute you were approached by officers and taken into custody, up until the point of your arraignment, if you had one? R:\tWait, what? I:\tWhat was happening that day? R:\tWhat day? Which one? I:\tThe first arrest. R:\tGraffiti, just being stupid; doing graffiti. I:\tWere you with friends? R:\tNo. I:\tJust by yourself? When the officers approached you, were they really clear with what they were going to do? Did they read you your rights? R:\tI dont remember. I:\tDid they take you in and book you? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tDid they call your family? Did your family come? R:\tYep. I:\tI know these questions sound silly, but  I mean, so you knew why they were stopping you and stuff? How many times have you been convicted? Okay. So, have you been to juvenile detention? R:\tNo. I:\tJail? R:\tYes. I:\tHow many times? R:\tOnce. I:\tAnd was that the time when you were 16, or was-- R:\tNo, that was later. That was the second one. I:\tHow old were you? R:\tI want to say I was 24. I:\tHow long were you there for? R:\tHonestly, only four days. Im not going to try to beef it up at all. I:\tAny experiences with probation or parole? R:\tNope. I:\tAnything else you want to add about time in jail? Theres lots of questions coming up about that. R:\tYeah. I:\tSo now I want to understand how you feel about legal authorities. So, on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities. R:\tIm going to say strongly disagree. I:\tPeople should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tI disagree. I:\tSomewhat, or-- R:\tJust somewhat. I:\tIts difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tIts kind of a weird double negative. The middle one. I:\tNeither agree nor disagree? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs that because its so dependent on what you do? R:\tNo, the law is dependent on what they decide it is. You know, I went to this, you know, ACLU thing, and theyre like, oh, you know, we have to take down selective policing. And I was like, okay, well, I just jaywalked in front of a police officer to get here. He decided not to ticket me and, you know, slap me with a citation or whatever. Thats selective policing, as well. He chose not to follow the law under every letter, or else wed all be getting tickets for stupid shit we did. The little double parking you did to go in and grab a coffee and come back out--oh, my friends right there--oh, a cop doesnt see and just walks on by. Its all different shades of selective policing. We just decide to focus on the more sensational shit, you know. Lawmakers do that all the time, you know, when they usher in their little buddy. Oh, Ill stamp that off for you--you know, the zoning permits or these bozos making this shit. The law is just as malleable as they want it to be. So, thats why Im saying these questions are kind of goofy in my mind, because they dont really answer to anybody, other than natural law, which just says adapt or die. And whatever their interpretation with the law that that has to be is what the law is going to be. So, Ill be straight up. If some white dude rolled up on me in a black hoodie and whatever, and he looked threatening, and I had a weapon, Im going to reach for that weapon. He could be a white dude from Piedmont with a nice education and speak really good English. But the law of nature says that dude looks like he might do something to me, and Im going to get him first, because Im not going to take that chance. Selective? Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? So, I mean, when we talk about the law, its never the one thing. So, when we say about, how do you break the law with keeping your self-respect, you know, thats a question for them. How do you do that shit? I dont know. One day at a time, I guess. I:\tHow about this one? The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me. R:\tId strongly agree with that. I:\tPeople in power use the law to control people like me. R:\tYeah, strongly agree. I:\tThe law does not protect my interests. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tMost police in my city do their job well. R:\tI havent done enough research. In the middle; I cant really say. I dont want to give an answer. I:\tMost police in my city treat people with respect. R:\tI dont know. I havent had enough interactions. I:\tThe basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by the police. R:\tId agree. I:\tSomewhat or strongly? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tThe police in my city have too much power. R:\tId strongly agree. You know, I think they all do. I:\tMost police in my city treat some people better than others. R:\tYeah, strongly agree with that. I:\tIs there a specific story that youre remembering, or just-- R:\tNo, no. I just know. I:\tHave you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, or questioned by the police? R:\tYes. I:\tHow many times would you say thats happened in your lifetime? R:\tId say about ten times. I:\tWhen was the last time that happened? R:\tEight months ago, a year ago. I:\tCan you describe that experience? R:\tNo, I dont really remember it too well. I mean, it wasnt a whole Hollywoodized Boyz n the Hood thing; it was just a really unpleasant experience with a ticket. It was a long, drawn-out thing where it was just kind of stupid as shit, but dont worry about it. I:\tSo I mean, did they stop you for no reason, or was it that your interactions with the cop were negative? R:\tWell, it was an unnecessary aggravation of a ticket. So, it was a citation for something small. I did, you know, go through a walkway on my bike. But what happened is, when they got to court, the fine was huge. And I was like, man, why is this fine--I was really stressed out. And then I found out that the cop had actually aggravated what Id done to saying that I blew through the intersection in a car, which is a vehicular thing, and it bumped it up to a misdemeanor, as opposed to just a simple citation. And so I dont know if he did that for the white lady that he stopped later, but I was definitely like, wow, that was shit. And then like I said, its not the Hollywoodized one that Ive had happen before, but it was still kind of unnerving and a bad experience. I:\tHave you had the Hollywoodized kind of experience, too? R:\tYeah, but, you know, theres too many of those. You guys dont want those. I:\tWe do. R:\tBut why? Theres someone out there with a better one. Theres always a better one, because now out there, you know, that one woman has the king story of them all. So, I mean, it wouldnt matter whether it was the most Hollywood or the most E! True Hollywood. You know, what youre doing--its difficult to take the qualitative and put it in a quantitative. I could tell you this thing, but whoevers reading this isnt going to care. Its like when they watch an Al Jazeera Plus video online. Theyll be like, oh, thats so sad. And then theyll scroll by. So, I might as well just tell you a numerical version of how many times, because you can rack up as many of these stories as possible, but its not going to sway the people on high who really make it. I dont know what will. I mean, if its not data, if its not people, then were kind of losing hope. So, I mean, well just leave you with that one, because it doesnt really matter. I:\tSo to what extent do you think race has shaped your experience with the police? R:\tVery heavily. I dont know. Its difficult to get into it, because I just dont know where it begins and where it ends. But Ill just say its undeniably changed my relationship with the police and my interaction with the legal field. I:\tDo you feel like there was a point in time in your younger years that you didnt feel that way about? R:\tI guess, but thats simply due to ignorance, you know. You know, you dont learn about this stuff; you just live about it, you know. So, you know, I mean, I guess when I was really young  I was never like, oh, I want to be a police officer when I grow up. But I wasnt raised as the super militant fear the--I was raised, you know, be polite with the police, you know. Follow the law, you know. Dont go to jail sort of thing; try to stay out of there, you know. Do something with your life; get an education. I was never given this whole sis-boom-bah long tirade about the police, and this is what they do, and youre a young brown man, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And that theatricality was lost on me. So, you know, just pretty neutral experience with the police, you know, up until probably my adolescent years. I:\tAnd then they were negative? R:\tMore negative than positive. I dont think Ive really had too many positive experiences. I:\tSo the next set of questions is about the arrest that led to your most recent pretrial detention experience. So, the time you spent in jail waiting for a decision on your case. So, what were the circumstances that led to that arrest? R:\tSo that is not the Hollywood story youre going to get; thats the hangover story youre going to get. Basically, the story is this: I was out with my friends. One of my friends was having an engagement party. We went out to go get drinks at a bar in the Mission District area of San Francisco. I just got way too drunk, got out of control, was walking around the neighborhood. I believed I saw a backyard that looked similar to the one that I lived by in my mothers house. And so I tried to climb a fence to get to the backyard, thinking it was mine. Walked up some stairs, knocked on a door, you know, asked for--you know, I guess I was trying to call for my mom or some shit. Passed out, and they found me. You know, like I said, trespassing/D&D. To my legal defense, I do not remember anything. I dont remember what transpired between me and the police. I dont know what was said between the point of me blacking out at a bar and to me waking up in a holding cell. So, I dont know anything other than that. But thats it. Thats the story behind my latest arrest--but my only story of incarceration, really. I:\tSo you say you were there for four days? R:\tFour days, yeah. I:\tAnd what was it like there? Can you describe the other people who were there with you, or whatever the jail cell was like? R:\tIt was four cells, six bunks each. Thats about 24 people. I mean, to tell you the truth, it was pretty multiculturally balanced. I think the least-represented people were Asian people, and it was one Asian dude there. Mostly African-American, other Latino guys, a white guy. You know, like I said, a couple of Asian dudes. But that was, you know, pretty chill. Honestly, it was just boring. Its really boring. I:\tWhat was the biggest challenge while you were there? R:\tJust keeping busy. A lot of the inmates spent their time watching television. You know, Im an active guy, so I kind of befriended this one cellmate of mine. And yeah, just passed time there. That was it; so bored; really boring there. I:\tDid you keep in touch with that guy, or-- R:\tNo. I:\tJust for the moment, you talked with him? R:\tYeah. I mean, we talked about it, but, I mean, I dont think anything really came of it. I think I shot him an email right after I got out, but I dont think anything ever transpired. I:\tWere there any informal rules that you held onto while you were there? R:\tLike I said, the rules of nature. You know, you dont have to be the alpha male, but you dont want to be the prey. I:\tCould you tell in there who was the alpha male and who was the prey? R:\tI mean, it was really situational. I mean, I really wouldnt say there was one person in general that everybody was afraid of, but, you know, you definitely wanted to hold your own. I mean, I think that was pretty much it. My technique was just, try to be friendly to everybody. You know, dont do the whole fight somebody the first day. You know, I got pushed into that, and then, you know, I kind of told them--I was like, oh come on, let up, you know. And he just took an orange from me. And it was really about negotiation more than anything. I think that was the biggest concern of mine--is just being able to negotiate with my new friends, and be like, you know, Im not trying to cause trouble; Im just trying to sit my ass down in my bunk, go to sleep, and get the fuck out of here. Im trying to do some pushups, whatever. Im not trying to rock the boat, get involved with shit--although things almost happened, but you just got to keep a cool head. Thats all I remember, you know. Thats what I learned about when I was telling you about the whole politics thing. Its like, man, it dont matter that youre some white dude, or youre some black dude, or whatever. Were all in here. Were all trying to make it to tonight without getting sent to the hole, or getting the shit beat out of us, or whatever. We understood that there was something greater above us that could fuck with us. So, we dont want to rock the boat too much. One time, two guys almost got into a fight, but, I mean, I was trying my hardest to try to deescalate the situation nonphysically, just being like--yo, peace, gentlemen. I know you guys are homies. You know what I mean? The guards are going to come. Lets not do that shit, blah, blah, blah. That was the most strenuous fucking three minutes of my life. Thats it, because youre locked with these people. And these guys close the cage. But like I said, it had nothing to do with us versus the cops, or, you know, black versus Latino versus white. You know, it was none of that shit. It was just like, how are we all going to get to sleep at night really restfully? Thats all that I really cared about. Maybe some other people had, you know, other little games. You know, there was some guy in there trying to make alcohol--you know, usual jail shit, you know. Cops definitely were not our friends in that situation. I was not a happy camper for a lot of that; did not like getting woken up with, you know, batons rattling on my shit. But, you know, thats how it has to be, I suppose. Thats what they know. But yeah, nothing too Hollywoodish, nothing too   just boring, very, very boring. I:\tWere there any responsibilities or obligations that you were unable to fulfill, like work or, you know, family-- R:\tYeah, yeah. I wasnt able to attend an interview for a job that I wanted for that weekend. Yeah. I:\tDid you call them and tell them why? R:\tWell, I didnt have their number, you know. I didnt know too many peoples numbers like that. I:\tWere there any arrangements you had to make so that obligations were fulfilled? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tWere there any services or programs available to you when you were there? R:\tNo. Since I was just in pretty much drunk tank, they didnt really open anything up to me--not that I didnt ask for it, but theyre just like, youre here for four days. The paperwork would take too long. I didnt even get to get my commissary. You know, my mom sent me all this crap through commissary and money. And I didnt even get to enjoy it, which was kind of stupid. I was really upset about that, actually. I:\tDid she get the money back? R:\tI dont think so. I:\tShe put money on the books, and then it was just gone? R:\tIt wasnt a lot, but it was enough that I was like, this is kind of a waste. I:\tYou said you were unconscious when they took you there. I mean, was there any medical attention that they gave you that you know of? R:\tI dont know anything. I:\tNothing like that? R:\tNope. I:\tWas there anything there that you wish had been offered that wasnt? R:\tNo. I mean, Im not cognizant of what people should get or not get in jail, you know. I mean, at its crux, it was kind of like an adult timeout. I dont think that the idea behind that is really rehabilitation; its more meditation. Its like, if within this amount of time, you cant figure out why what you did wasnt fucked up, I dont know what else is going to happen. Thats kind of how it was with the CDRP program. I:\tAnd that was court-ordered because of this incident? R:\tYeah. I:\tSo you said your mom knew about it. How did she react to it? R:\tHonestly, she had been dealing with my alcohol abuse for a while. She wasnt like, oh, go in there; stay in there, blah, blah, blah--but shes like, you need to take responsibility for what you did. Youre going to have to wait it out. Its not the worst thing in the world. You didnt hurt anybody, you know. You didnt get hurt. Youre just going to, you know, just sit in there and reflect on what this is. Its what happens. Shes like, this is what happens when you lose control, when you choose to lose control. You know what I mean?  I:\tDid she come and visit you at all? R:\tYeah, but thats what she told me. You know, she wasnt doing this whole crying on the bars shit. Shes like, yeah, spend some time up in here. I couldnt get through to you, you know. Shes like, I wish it didnt have to come to this, but, you know, you chose to do that shit. You know what I mean? I respected her for that. You know, I respected that she wasnt, you know, crying or asking the cops why--or, you know, even saying, oh, this is racism, blah, blah, blah. I mean, even I couldnt say anything to that perspective. Its like, yeah, this was criminal. I was in the midst of a crime--albeit, you know, there were white people Ive met whove been in a similar situation that got driven home and, you know, whatever. And they bought them Starbucks and shit. But, you know, it wasnt they just beat the shit out of me, and then threw me in here, and I didnt get any phone calls or anything. You know, it was just your basic, oh, [Name]s drunk. Spring him in drunk tank; do what it does. So, I learned, you know, kind of a little, you know, give and take, in a sense. I:\tWere there any barriers that made it difficult to keep in touch with your family while you were there for the four days? R:\tJust technical shit. Their phones suck. I:\tSo I know theres one about, didnt have access to phones. R:\tI had access, but the phones are janky. I mean, yeah. Well, you know what? Thats actually really misconstruing the facility. I mean, honestly, it was more other, in a sense that, you know, when you call--you can only really call out, so nobody can really call back in. And its really difficult to call back in. So, my mom would call, and someone was on the phone, and shed basically spend money to call in. You know, it was a whole thing, you know, but thats why. You know, it costs money to call from jail.  I:\tWere you eventually released before a decision was made on your case? R:\tI mean, well, thats the thing. There wasnt really a decision made. I mean, thats just procedure--they bring you in, they book you, process you. You know, I had the vast misfortune of being taken in on a Friday night. So, I stayed Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, you know. So, you know, I was able to meet with a lawyer. We were able to do a little arrangement sort of deal; kind of said and done pretty quickly. I:\tWell, did they give you the option of pretrial right then when they released you, or did they set a court date that you had to come back for? R:\tThey did both. So, they set the court date; then they gave me information for the pretrial attorney. So, thats when I was able to be like, okay, you know. Its all pretty fuzzy. I mean, basically, what happened was, yeah, yeah. Yeah, thats what happened. During the trial, the guy is like, okay. Hes my public defender. And hes like, okay, were going to do--[Name] came up with some ridiculous defense that actually worked. Its not ridiculous like some bad people. It was just essentially saying that I was too drunk to have intent to commit crime, which is one of those laws thats wiggy. So, if I get too drunk and beat the hell out of my wife, I can say, oh, I was too drunk to know, you know--slippery slope. But he was like, oh, he was too intoxicated to be able to commit crime. He thought that it was his mothers house. Its just he got drunk and whatever. And then he said, but [Name] will be, you know, going to pretrial diversion. And then at pretrial diversion, theyre like, youre mandated to take XYZ. So, it was kind of this chain link thing where my PD was like, okay, go to pretrial diversion. Pretrial diversion was like, okay, go to CDRP. So, I dont remember what happened. You know, I mean, it happened like that, you know. Went to trial, he told me that, then we met, and said, you go to pretrial diversion, say youre going to this program, and then we just check in every few months with pretrial diversion with receipts of attendance from your classes. Bring them in, and once you have--I think they said 24. It actually wasnt that bad. I made it sound really shitty, but 24 sessions of these things--then you say youre good. So, thats the narrative. I:\tSo were you released on personal recognizance, or did you have to post bail, or anything like that? R:\tNo, just whatever recognizance or some shit, yeah. I:\tDid you have to pay anything for your release? R:\tThey actually took my money and my jersey. Im really upset about that. I:\tWhen you were booked, they took your stuff? R:\tWell, so what happened is, when I was handcuffed, I was found without a shirt on. And, you know, its effing cold. And I had money in my pockets. I remember, you know, going to the bar. And when I got my stuff back, theyre like, oh, no, we lost a lot of your stuff. And I was like, what? Okay. So, yeah, I ended up losing about  the jersey was a ton of money. Not a ton, but a good amount of money. Then $30 was gone, you know. Theyre just like, oh, it just got lost in processing. I was like, okay, whatever. Theyre like, if you want to file this report, you can. I was like, Im not going to come back here. Im never coming back here. I:\tRight--for $30. R:\tYeah, fuck that shit. I:\tYou talked a little bit about the process. Were you asked to set any goals or anything the day you were released? R:\tWhat do you mean? Released from what? I:\tFrom jail. R:\tNo. No, there was no promises. Nothing was said to me. They just said, all right, its time to go. Wait here. Well fill out your form, and you go. I:\tWere there any concerns you had about preparing for pretrial release, or anything you were worried about when you were getting out? R:\tWell, I was worried about the degree of expungement. What would this expunge? Would it just be dropped down? Would it be expunged? And that was the only real concern I had, other than actually being hit for a crime at the pretrial thing, where theyre like, oh, actually, the police said he fought back. And then it was going to be like, oh shit--because that was my biggest worry--because if I said, I dont have the intent to do crime, thats an open doorway for the cops to be like, oh, well, he did all this other stuff, and he cant prove that he didnt. Thats the only thing I was stressed out about. I was like, damn, if the cops come, and theyre like, oh, yeah, he swung at me, and then tried to run, and then we had to tackle him, and then he wriggled out of his shirt--thats why he didnt have a shirt. Its like a free pass, really. You know, thats what I was really worried about--trumping up the charges--more than anything, you know. Oh, he spit on us. Oh, he yelled, you know, whatever. You know, he claimed a gang. He was wearing this color. I didnt have a shirt on. Theyd be like, oh, he was wearing a red shirt, you know. So, these things go through your head when youve lived the life Ive lived, you know. They can tack on shit that you cant fight because you literally dont have a way. I cant go back in my brain and be like, oh, this didnt happen, you know. So, that was my biggest concern, really, is just the injustice in itself. I:\tDid any bad stuff come to fruition, or was it-- R:\tNo. I mean, you know, its a Friday night drunk run. You know, these guys dont want to get called in for that shit. They barely remember it, you know. Theyre not going to make a mouse out of a molehill unless  I mean, the only reason they would is if I did get minorly aggressive with them, and then they decided to said, oh, this is an open leeway. But if youre doing drunk runs, you know, you dont want to deal with the extra paperwork or whatever. Just bring the fucker in, and just be done, you know. Two other guys who were riding in the squad car--they got it worse, because the police officers who picked them up picked them up in a stolen vehicle, but it was his vehicle that he just hadnt registered yet, you know. It was in his moms name. Address was there, license--and he was telling this to me in the car, and I couldnt say, shut the fuck up. Dont say shit while were in the car. Dont say shit, you know--because that was even worse. I mean, that couldve been something even worse, you know. They were released pretty instantaneously. I was in there. Thats what kind of got me tripping. Its like, man, these guys actually got caught for kind of a lightweight thing. Anyway, I was, you know, released. It was fine. But that was my only concern--that it would get aggravated beyond the point of what it really was. I:\tWere there any negative consequences you experienced as a result of being held--like lost a job, lost a relationship, housing, car, property-- R:\tWell, you know, propertys whatever, but I lost that job opportunity, more than anything, you know. I lost a possibility to teach a class over the summer, which really couldve transformed my life, honestly. So, that was kind of one of the biggest things I felt regret about. I:\tWas your experience in detention different from what you thought it would be? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow so? R:\tIt might just be me, but I expected more violence from police, from my fellow inmates. And not to say that it was hunky-dory, but the way I describe it is, it was like the worst summer camp Ive been to. It was the worst sleepaway camp Ive been to. It was shit. But I did learn a lot about the human condition, and about the justice system, and about myself. So, I mean, it kind of exceeded expectations in a lot of ways.  I:\tJust that the other people in there werent as frightening as you thought they would be? R:\tKind of. I mean, the whole experience was more just negatively awakening, you know. Its like, this is an experience I dont want to have again. I:\tDo you feel like you were changed at all by being in detention? R:\tOh, yeah. I:\tHow so? R:\tI mean, I dont know. I mean, I found myself trying to understand both sides of the equation that I was on. You know, the job of the cops, you know, what makes people choose to reinterpret the law, you know, what makes right or wrong on a book, you know, what makes right or wrong in our lives. You know, one of the books I read in there was a book Id never have read in my life. Its this older book; Id say published maybe 1995, 97. But it was for mothers--how to deal with the loss of an infant, whether while pregnant, you know, stillborn, or in early stages of development. And its at that moment that I realized one truth--is that nature does not give a shit about you, or him, or her, or any of these people. Life is not guaranteed at any certain point in time, you know. And theres no politic behind it. You know, like we were saying about the cause--and fuck that shit. Nature has destroyed life, has extinguished life based on just weird blips in the universe. Doesnt matter what we do to this planet. Yeah, okay, its probably a great idea not to poison the water that we drink, but on a greater level, I mean, nature will always bounce back. There will always be something. You know, our feeble concept of existence is just by what we see. And so even when I was in there, I was like, this isnt really real. This is an experience that I can get over. I can either retain this experience, or I can have it define me. So, I can say, oh, you know, I couldve easily went right back to where I was in middle school--oh, they did it because theyre racist, oh, and because, you know, blah, blah, it was a white man, and blah, blah, blah, and duh, duh, duh. And that shit wouldnt get me any further in life than the real criminal, which was me. It was a man that looked like me who decided to go through those things, to grab that bottle, to do that shit, to say that thing, to do that thing. Theres nothing in between. Theres no God. Theres no force. Theres no nothing. Its just you and the decisions you make. And so whether its cop, criminal, citizen, whoever, you follow those rules of nature however you define it until nature catches up with you. And thats what I was telling this other people. I had this, you know, vision of, sometimes, you know, this book about, you know, humans not making it--maybe thats nature fighting back, and its like, maybe theres too many of you. I just learned that the planet can only support nine billion people feasibly. Now the world as we do it cant even feasibly support one billion people adequately, you know. A bunch of people get too much, and a bunch of people get too little, right? So, when nature decides that the big plague is going to come, it dont give a shit about no Black Lives Matter, no whatever lives matter. Your life wont matter. Nature just does. You know what I mean? Things die every day, you know. Ecosystems disappear because of the smallest fluctuations of the environment. Coral reefs die, you know, that used to be there. We dont fucking hold protests, you know, over them or whatever. The world is slowly changing, and dying, and regrowing. You know, it gave me this odd sense of, who the fuck cares anymore? I just want to be happy, and I dont want to be caged anymore. Thats my own thing. I just dont want to be caged. You know, I want to be one of these techie morons or even these academics. And I come from academia, but I cant spend my life in a cage, you know. I dont think any human should. I think that, you know, if it was up to me, professors should be doing their classes outside, for people to be able to learn from this, you know. Some of these people who are sitting out here have education. Imagine this, right? Imagine the dollar just stopped having value, right? How would you survive in the next week, right? Think about this. You dont have a dollar. And that doesnt mean, oh, I cant buy, you know, my bars at whatever, you know, Whole Foods; I cant get whatever. It means they dont have money, either. It means the CEOs that run the company dont have money. It means that these people right here are the only people with the know-how to survive. So, where does the law go after that? What does the law really mean when the cops cant even afford a bullet anymore? They cant afford to, you know, drive around and patrol anymore. Now they got to walk around and actually interact with people. How does the law change now that the system of policing is more personal because of a lack of resources, you know? Its not until that day happens that we dont think about it. Its like with this whole movement in Oakland. I said, okay, check it out. Imagine if one day in Oakland, the police just said, were going to go on strike for one month. If you guys are all about this people power, blah, blah, blah, we the people, power to the people shit, lets do it, one month, no authority. You fight your own fires, heal your own--oh, you want to sell your little crystals and your herbs? Okay, so when your homie has a heart attack, lets give him those herbs. How will natural law win out? Its not that it will or it wont; it will. How will it do so? And thats what I learned in there. I:\tSo would you say thats the good that came from it, was this kind of larger life purpose existential kind of  R:\tI mean, its ruthlessness, too, because there are people--I mean, nature creates cruelty, you know. And there may be people who are psychotic who need to be in jail, who are detrimental to their own health and to the health of others. And you know what? Thats fine, because nature says, you adapt and survive by any means necessary. So, if theres some wing nut out there bugging out, you know--out here in Berkeley, theyre like, oh no, we should try to understand. We should try to see where hes from. Well, guess what? Jeffrey Dahmer was simply born with a neurological disorder that tied mutilation to his sexual desire. Nothing about his upbringing, nothing about his race/ethnicity, or anything--its just he got a shit luck of the draw from Mother Nature, and his brain was just wired that way. The blame doesnt fall on anybody. Hes an educated white male from middle America, you know. He wasnt Dylan Klebold. He wasnt Timothy McVeigh. His brain was just wired in a way that made him a freak. And thats fine. But nature doesnt care about your little 20/20 special asking about, oh, mental health/wellness, blah, blah, because guess what? In nature, that person gets eaten up, or exiled, or killed--because the tribe doesnt have time to deal with that shit. Yeah, maybe if some kid, you know, like me, has ADD, and, you know, doesnt want to work in the fields, and he wants to do some arts and crafts--okay, so the kid likes to paint. Whatever. Hes not jacking off to a mutilated body or something. Nature doesnt play fair. Actually, no--she doesnt play right; she just plays fair. Its up to us to decide that right or wrong, you know. I:\tSo this next section is about the process by which you were assessed for the diversion program you participated in. So, you did participate in pretrial diversion, yes? R:\tYep. I:\tSo how were you told that you were being considered for pretrial? R:\tMy PD told me that I could be considered for this. I:\tAnd so did your PD help you make sense of all your options and give you some really good information about it? R:\tYep, he was cool. I:\tDid you participate in an interview to determine your eligibility at all? R:\tWell, the interview was during the pretrial counsel. So, when we were talking together, he did the little interview. I:\tYour PD did, or someone else? R:\tYeah, the PD. Well, so it was the public defender, and she had an intern. So, the intern was actually the one who did the interview for pretrial. I think thats what he was just supposed to do, you know. I:\tDo you feel like you got enough information to make an informed decision about it, and  R:\tYeah. I:\tYou were able to explain the conduct that led to you being put in jail at that time, or no? R:\tSomewhat. Like I said, able to explain what I knew to my knowledge. I:\tWere there any factors that went into your decision to participate, or was it pretty much just like a heres what youre going to do kind of thing? R:\tI mean, it was definitely the best option to do, you know. I:\tSo sometimes they do an interview to determine your risk of reoffending and your service needs. Were you ever made aware of your level of risk that was assigned to you? R:\tNo, I dont recall that part. I:\tWere you ever made aware of an assessment about your needs? R:\tWhich needs? I:\tSo you said that they ended up sending you to the treatment program. Did they interview you to decide if you needed such a thing? R:\tYeah, yeah. I mean, that was all part of the main counsel. Initially, they told me, okay, heres our strategy on a legal tip. Then theyre like--it wasnt a plea, but its like, okay, but heres what youre going to agree to do, you know, to help encourage them to allow you into the pretrial. And then with the pretrial diversion people, those are the people that I spelled out exactly how I was going to go to this. So, I said, okay, this is the program Im going to be signing up for. This is how many times Im required to do it. This is when Im going to go, and Im going to bring you this documentation sort of shit. I:\tDid you agree with what they laid out for you? R:\tYeah. I:\tStrongly, or-- R:\tStrongly agreed. I:\tHow much do you feel like the program would help you reduce your odds of reoffending? R:\tStrongly, very much so. I:\tWhat was making you so optimistic about it? R:\tThat I was given another chance. I think that was the biggest thing, you know. It was an experience that wasnt just going to stop me in my tracks professionally, and I had this opportunity--an option to just kind of do something different. I:\tDo you remember how much it cost to participate? R:\tI think it was $90 or something like that. It wasnt more than $100. I think I got some sort of waiver, because I was on my own at the time, yeah. I:\tSo you were able to afford it? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow were you able? Just savings? R:\tYeah, just savings. You know, I had some money saved up. I:\tAnd you think it was reduced due to low-income status? R:\tSomething like that, yeah. I remember going to him and saying, oh, you know, I really--because I had to pay for the treatment, as well. And I said, you know, if Im paying for the treatment, Id like to ask that, you know, I be waived. I:\tSo what exactly were the conditions of your participation? So, you had to go to classes in addition to the treatment, or just the treatment? R:\tClasses were the treatment. I mean, so alcoholism isnt something you just go bippity-boppity-boo and youre gone. They had a multitiered program. So, there were, you know, discussion groups. There were one-on-one therapy sessions. There were workshops about alcohol, the science of alcohol. Some of them were larger group check-ins, larger group meetings, and stuff like that. So, it was a multifaceted program. I:\tAnd you had to do all of those things at some point? R:\tYeah. I:\tWas there anything that you felt like was better than others, in terms of your progress? R:\tNo, nothing. I mean, I think the larger group stuff helped a lot. It was good. I think that some of the scientific knowledge about alcohol helped me understand a lot about, you know, exactly--you know, I would say, oh man, my bodys feeling so shitty [inaudible 84:06] alcohol. And they just were able to say, okay, well, this is why. And I was like, wow, scientific theorem. If I dont do alcohol, then my body feels good, and I dont feel shitty, you know. So, it was in my best interest, you know. I:\tWith the educational pieces there. R:\tYep. I:\tDo you remember the length of your time? R:\tI think it was about two months worth of it. I:\tDo you remember how that was determined, or was it just, you know, the typical what everybody gets treatments? R:\tNo, it was because of the pretrial diversion. You know, I let them know. I let the place know from the jump Im only doing 24, and this is a part of my thing. I:\tWas there anything else that the program did to address your needs, like job assistance, counseling, educational-- R:\tNo, not really. I:\tThere was nothing that was even offered to you that you--okay. So, what was the extent and nature of supervision? Did you have to check in with somebody? R:\tYeah. I mean, well, every one of these times, you had to check in--and, you know, just our progress, and how we were feeling, and, you know, any feelings of remission and shit. Thats pretty much it. So, nothing chemical or whatever. I:\tBut there wasnt [inaudible 75:29] pretrial that you had to call every week or anything? R:\tI recall I did have to check in, I think, once a month with the pretrial diversion people, to show them my documents--because I had to go in there physically and show them every time. But that was pretty much it as the only kind of check-in, really. I:\tWere there any benefits you got from participating--personal relationships-- R:\tYeah, personal relationships, a lot of things. Thats pretty much it. Personal, professional relationships were enhanced and bettered. I:\tSo you met people while you were there that you connected with, or-- R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tThat you later started working with, or just-- R:\tNo, just friends. I:\tWere there any negative consequences associated with participating? Nothing at all? It didnt keep you from working or anything like that? Okay. So, tell me about the program participants you got to know. R:\tThey were just friendly people, willing to open up with stories. You know, just helped me answer some questions about, you know, the larger things about my recovery and stuff, but thats it. I:\tWere there any staff that you felt like you got to know? Nobody? R:\tNope, not really. I:\tWas it a different person every time? R:\tNo, but, you know, like I said, you know, I dont want to tie myself down to that experience. So, I didnt really try to make any friends with people. Why would I make friends with somebody who might pull me back into that, you know? Even if it is, you know, one of the staff people, theyre talking about alcohol all the time, and they probably drink, you know. I never saw anybody from that time in my life again. I just dont think it would be positive. I:\tSo was it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tOh, yeah. I:\tWhen? R:\tJust difficult. I:\tJust to get there every day? R:\tNo, just to be there sometimes. I:\tHow did you stick to it? R:\tWell, if I dont, I dont get expunged. I:\tDid anybody in particular help you get through that? R:\tJust me. I:\tWere you ever accused of violating the program requirements? R:\tOnce, but thats why I stopped going to that program for a while. Yeah, it was ridiculous. I:\tWas there a system in place for you to dispute that claim that youd violated it? R:\tNo, not really. I mean, it wasnt something to dispute. It was just a ridiculous technicality. I went to a party, and the guys like, oh, heres a nonalcoholic beer. And, you know, I guess I confessed that, and I was like, oh, well, it tasted really good. Maybe this is an alternative. And the guys like, uh, uh, uh [no]. Hes like, you got to reset your days, because it has 0.5 percent alcohol. And thats when I flipped out, and I was like, all right. And then hes like, oh, theres people that if they eat a rum cake, then theyll get triggered. Then I said, well, then those people are just, you know, physiologically flawed. Thats not an addiction; thats a medical condition. And theres nothing you can do, or say, or whatever thats going to stop people from, you know, getting triggered like that. And so I just flew off the rails, and I was like, fuck you, fuck the program. And I was like, and thats me trying to be honest. I was like, now imagine all the people in here who arent saying anything, and are just getting drunk all the time, and just playing you like a fiddle. And I was like, you ever think of that? You know, I reset my days. It was like, fine, whatever; Ill prove you wrong. I just wont say anything anymore. I didnt drink, but I also let him know that he didnt win. So, that was my-- I:\tYou had to start all over, though? R:\tYeah, I had to start all over. And that meant more time away, you know, more stress. Fortunately, I wasnt really working a job, other than the freelance thing. And the other job I was working was kind of--they were pretty malleable in helping me get through that, pretty understanding. But I was just really stressed out, and I was not happy about that experience. I:\tSo this next section is about how the participation in the program ended. So, were you told exactly what you needed to do to get through the program? R:\tYep, yep, from beginning to end. I:\tWere you able to meet those obligations? R:\tYep. I:\tCould you explain how the program ended? Were you notified? R:\tNo, I just got my 24 logins, you know, brought them to the thing, and they said, okay, [Name], well send you an email. And then got the email saying it was expunged, and that was it, you know. Nothing fancy, no, you know, ending of the program things. It kind of just happened. And I was out. I:\tYou didnt have to go back to court or anything? R:\tNo, no. Actually, no. I did have to go back to court one more time, but thats just basically where my PD was just like, oh, he finished it. Heres the documentation and a copy of it. And then the pretrial diversion people saying--its them saying it, and then heres me saying it, and heres you with all the documents. So, that was it. I went in for one hour, handed them some papers. I said, you know, my apologies. Ive gone through the program. You know, Ive got my drinking under control. You know, Im working at my job again. I:\tSo it was really clear that the charges were dropped, and you were done with it? R:\tYeah, very, very clear. I:\tSo to what extent do you agree with the following? Overall, the program was very helpful. Strongly agree to strongly disagree. R:\tYou know, Id agree. I think it was very, very helpful. I think it was really helpful. I:\tI mean, was there anything that you felt was particularly helpful? R:\tNo. I mean, you know, my case was different, so I cant really say it was one way or the other. I:\tWould you recommend it to others? R:\tYeah. I:\tAre there any issues that you think required addressing in terms of how the program treats its clients and addresses their needs? R:\tI dont really remember the intricacies of all of it. I:\tSo not really? Do you feel like the program prepared you to deal with challenges after your participation ended? R:\tYep. I:\tThey gave you all the tools you needed, and-- R:\tYeah. I:\tDid you have access to people that you could contact if you ever needed help? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I:\tThey set you up with resources and things, or-- R:\tYep. I:\tWhat was the first month like after your release? R:\tI mean, just trying to get back to normal. Thats pretty much it. I didnt want to harp on it, or give it any more weight than it needed to be given. So, I was just trying to get back to my life. I:\tWhat do you think was the toughest adjustment you had to make? R:\tI dont know. I dont really know. I dont think there was any tough adjustment. I:\tWere there any kinds of assistance that you received? Okay. So, following your release, how did you support yourself financially? R:\tI was still freelancing, and I was able to get another job. I:\tSo for each of the following, Id like to know if you had access to a program or services that helped you with this issue, right? R:\tI didnt get any access to any services. I:\tNone of these? R:\tI mean, I dont go out for services too much at all, really. I:\tIts more like, did you have access, or were you aware that any of them existed? I mean, its fine if you-- R:\tWell, thats what Im saying. I wasnt told of any of these sorts of access. So, no, I wasnt given, you know--because I pretty much told them, you know, Im going to be fine, you know. Im not somebody with nothing or whatever. I can bounce back, you know. I:\tAre there any programs that you wish had been offered? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tTell me about your initial interactions with your family members after you were finished with diversion. R:\tFine. I mean, they were just glad I was done; could put it behind us. I:\tDo you feel like your participation affected your relationship to your family members? Did it change at all? R:\tYeah, sure. I:\tFor the better or worse? R:\tFor the better. I:\tA lot for the better? R:\tYeah, sure. I:\tHow so? Can you explain that a little bit? R:\tTheyre just glad Im done with it. Thats all. I:\tDo they recognize that youve made changes, or-- R:\tYeah, yeah. I:\tWhat types of support did they provide for you? Financial, housing, emotional, finding work-- R:\tEmotional. I:\tTell me about your initial interactions with your friends after your release. R:\tJust same as usual. You know, I just explained to them what happened, and told them a little story, but nothing different. I:\tSo not much changed there, or-- R:\tNo. I:\tDid they provide you with any kind of support? Did you keep in contact with the friends you were with the night that happened? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tWas it like you had a falling out after that, or just-- R:\tI just didnt contact them. I:\tSo Im going to ask you some questions about your housing situation. How many places did you live following your most recent release? R:\tJust one; been living in the same place. I:\tIs it your own place or apartment? R:\tApartment. I:\tWhat are the pros and cons of your living situation? R:\tI dont know. Its fine. I:\tIts the same now as it was then, right? R:\tYeah. I:\tHave you ever had trouble finding a place to live because of your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tNo. I:\tSo Im going to read some statements that describe your feeling toward your neighborhood. So, immediately following your trial from pretrial, what would you say to, In my first month out, I felt like my neighborhood was a safe place to live? R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tYes. I:\tIn my first month out, it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tIt was hard. No, it wasnt hard. I:\tDisagree or strongly disagree? R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tIn my first month out, I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. I:\tDrug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tYes. I:\tStrongly? R:\tYes. I:\tI cared about what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tNo, dont care. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who lived there could get it resolved. R:\tId probably disagree. I:\tI expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tYeah. I:\tStrongly agree? R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tSo now this is how you feel about your neighborhood today, if its different. R:\tIts not different. Its the same ones. I:\tDo you have any future goals? Are you planning on staying in this place forever? R:\tYeah, sure. Im staying in Berkeley for a while. I:\tBut do you have any goals to get your own place? R:\tNo, Im just going to stay in Berkeley. I:\tAnd your detention didnt affect where you lived or anything like that at all--okay. So, I told you before were going to go back to employment. So, you said that you were just doing the freelance thing immediately after your release. R:\tPretty much. I:\tWhen did you begin that kind of work? I know you told me; Im sorry. R:\tI dont remember what I said, but its there. Id say May 2011. Its what I said, I think. I:\tAnd back then, were you earning different kind of money, or still $700 a month? R:\tStill $700 a month. I:\tSo whenever you had periods of unemployment, how many hours a week would you say you search for work? Or how much time do you spend trying to find clients? Maybe thats a better question. R:\tFive hours a day. I:\tHow much effort would you say youve expended towards searching for work at a time? R:\tA lot. I:\tAnd what kind of methods do you use? R:\tAnything. Mostly just, you know, word of mouth [inaudible 101:21]. I:\tSo you dont have a criminal record, right? R:\tNo. I:\tIll leave it blank, I guess. Where do you see yourself in terms of work and employment in the next year, five years, ten years? R:\tWorking for myself, pretty much. I:\tIn a different capacity than what you do now? R:\tNo, not too much, but yeah, better capacity. I:\tJust expanding the kind of clients that you have? R:\tSure, yeah, yep. I:\tHave you incurred any debt related to your contact with the criminal justice system? You didnt have to pay restitution [inaudible 102:12] and that kind of thing; no fees? Okay. So in general, how would you say your criminal justice obligations have affected your life? R:\tNot at all. I mean, after that, not at all, not really. I:\tIs there anything you want to add, or anything thats going on in your life right now that we havent talked about? R:\tNo, nope, nope. I:\tDo you have any questions for me? R:\tNo. I:\tSo some of the things we talked about today could be considered sensitive or uncomfortable topics. Were there any topics or questions that you thought were particularly uncomfortable? R:\tNo. I:\tAny suggestions on how we might ask our questions more effectively? R:\tNo. I dont have any other comments. I:\tSo to help us get in touch with you for further questions if necessary, were asking for contact info on family members or friends. Are you willing to provide that, or no?

The police were trying to put it  They arrest  The extra  Squeezing my arm very tight and, you know, searching me down, and it was just like, \"Really?\" But, I guess, thats what happens when youre involved with the police.

I:\tOkay. How did you receive this info? R:\tIt was by mail. I:\tOkay. Was it the wrong address and you didnt get it in time or  ? R:\tNo, I got it in time, it was just that it was the wrong address and they said after court date theyd mail me something letting me know what happened but Im not at that address no more. I:\tOkay. To your knowledge, were you done with diversion, or  ? R:\tYeah. I thought I was like done with like pretrial  Oh, no, never mind. I:\tOkay.  R:\tIt was a [inaudible 26:32] program, I think.

R:\tAgree. I:\tOkay. People should obey the law even if it goes against what they think is right. R:\tAgree. I:\tOkay. It is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tCan you repeat the question? I:\tYeah. It is difficult to break the law and keep ones self-respect. R:\tDisagree. I:\tOkay. The law represents the values of the people in power rather than people like me. R:\tAgree. I:\tOkay. People in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tYou said what? I:\tPeople in power use the law to try to control people like me. R:\tDisagree. I:\tOkay. The law does not protect my interests. R:\tDisagree. I:\tOkay. Most police in my city do their job well.

To what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with police? R:\tYou said [inaudible 31:21] the what? I:\tTo what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experiences with police. R:\tI dont think it does, right?

      " I:\tHello? R:\tYeah. I:\tHi. We left off on talking about detention experiences, like the one week in jail you were talking about. R:\tOkay. I:\tAt that time, did you have your children? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. How long ago did this happen, for my reference? R:\t2008, I believe. I:\t2008, okay. Do you know if you were eventually from jail before a decision was made? R:\tNo. I was still in jail and I went to court that day and they decided to give me some type of program. I forgot the program. I:\tDo you know what conditions you were released under? R:\tUnder my own conditions and that I check in with probation and complete that program. I:\tDid you have a bail set by the courts? R:\tYeah. I forgot how much it was. I:\tOkay, that's all right. Did you end up having to pay that? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Could you tell me about the process of you being released from 850 Bryant? R:\tIt actually made me sick. When I got out that evening I was actually sick. I was throwing up. I had a stomach ache, so it was I was happy to be out and I also still was sick. I:\tDid they give you any help at all with that or no? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tWere you given any advice on your way out? R:\tNo. Just don't come back. I:\tWere you provided with any resources? R:\tNo. Not really. I:\tDid anyone help you plan what you were going to do immediately after? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Did you have any concerns doing the pre-trial release period? R:\tWhat I was going to do to get myself back on track and how I was going to be able to stay out of jail and just do what I have to do to get off probation. I:\tI'm going to list off some things and you can reply yes or no. These are negative consequences that you might have experienced as a result of being in pre-trial detention. R:\tOkay. I:\tThe first one is I lost my job. R:\tNo. I:\tI lost a partner or relationship. R:\tNo. I:\tLost housing. R:\tNo. I:\tLost my car. R:\tNo. I:\tDid you lose any other property? R:\tNo. I:\tDid you get any debt out of that experience? R:\tAny who? I:\tAny debt. R:\tWhat kinds of debt, like credit card debts or something? I:\tYeah. Any financial debt. R:\tNo. I:\tWas your experience in detention any different than what you had thought it would be? R:\tYeah. I:\tHow so? R:\tBecause I didn't think jail was like that and it turned out to be totally different. I never want to go back there again. I:\tDid you have an image of what jail would be like before? R:\tFrom seeing it on TV and movies, yeah, I thought it was going to be something similar, but getting in there and experiences it for yourself is a place you just don't want to be. Getting up, sleeping on a hard bed, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, eating their nasty food. It wasn't what I expected it to be. Females want to pick arguments with me and that's not me. I'm not about that lifestyle. I:\tDid you have any conflicts with some of the women in the jail? R:\tOne of them [inaudible 04:56]. I really couldn't do anything about it to defend myself. I:\tDid the law enforcement officers help you at all or no? R:\tYes, they did. I:\tHow so? R:\tThey broke us up. They separated us. I:\tOkay. Do you feel like you were changed in any way by this detention? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Did you feel like anything good came from it? R:\tHuh? I:\tDid you ever feel like something good came from it? R:\tNo. I:\tMoving onto the diversion part of your experience, so you said you did participate in a diversion program? R:\tYeah. They had little classes there. I was going to their classes. I:\tDo you remember how you were first told about diversion? R:\tUm-hum [no]. I:\tNo, okay. Did you have any counsel to help you through this process? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay, so did you didn't have a public defender? R:\tI did have a public defender, but it ain't like she came into the jail cell to come see me. I met her at court date. I:\tOkay. Got it. You didn't have any contact with her outside that? R:\tNo. I:\tAn interview is often conducted before you start pre-trial diversion, do you remember that happening? R:\tYes. I:\tDo you remember what kind of questions they asked you? R:\tNo. I forget, ma'am, totally forgot. I:\tNo, that's okay. Did you get along with the pre-trail diversion staff? R:\tYou say what? I:\tDid you get along with pre-trial diversion staff? R:\tYeah. I:\tDo you feel like you had a choice in the matter? R:\tNo, not really. I:\tWhy was that? R:\tI didn't really know them like that, so ... I:\tWhat factors affected your decision to participate? R:\tI just wanted to get out of jail, so I was taking any offers that was coming up just to help me get out of jail faster. I:\tAt any time were you aware of the level of risk that you were assigned? R:\tYeah, I was. I:\tDid you agree with that decision? R:\tYes, I did. I have to go in my daughter's school real fast to pick her up and we're not allowed to be on the phone. Can you hold on a second? I:\tYeah, not a problem. [Interruption] I:\tHello? R:\tYes, I'm here. I:\tOkay. Were you ever aware of an assessment that was made about your needs, and this is educational or emotional or mental? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Those classes, how much did you feel like those classes would keep you from re-offending? R:\tI don't know. I:\tIt's okay. R:\tGive me your hand. I:\tDo you feel like your experience in the jail was more persuasive? R:\tYeah, it was okay. Come on, get me your hand. I:\tDo you remember what diversion program you participated in? R:\tHuh? I:\tDo you remember which diversion program you participated in? R:\tNo. It was all of them. I think I was in [inaudible 13:11]. I:\tDo you remember what the classes were called? R:\tI think it was different questions, talking to us about different  [Interruption]  Talking to us about different things in our past, how did we get here, what can we do to not come back and stuff like that. I:\tDid you cost you anything to participate? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Do you remember the conditions of your participation? How many classed you had to attend? R:\tI think three. I was there for a week so I did Tuesday, Thursday and ... I think Tuesday and Thursday [inaudible 14:13]. It was like three. I:\tYou did that over two weeks? R:\tYeah. A week. I:\tA week, okay. What, if any, benefits did you get from your participation? R:\tHuh? I:\tNothing. R:\tNo. I:\tYou said that you were unsure if your program was finished? R:\tI don't know because I got out. I was only in there for a week and I got out that week. I don't know if the program's finished or not. I:\tWhat time did you participate in diversion? R:\tI think ... I:\tWhat was that again? R:\tI'm not sure. I:\tOkay. Did you feel like there were negative consequences to diversion? [Interruption] R:\tHello. I:\tHi. R:\tI'm sorry. I:\tWhat, if any, negative consequences did you experience because of diversion? R:\tNothing. I just had a felony on my [inaudible 16:10] and it stopped me from getting housing, but other than that, I'm fine. I:\tDo you know what exactly is on your criminal record right now? R:\tA drug felony. [Inaudible 16:29] is trying to drop it down to a misdemeanor. I:\tDid you get to know any other participants in diversion? R:\tI don't associate with [inaudible 16:42]. I:\tDid you get to know any of the staff at all? [Interruption] I:\tHi. Did you interact with any of the staff at diversion? R:\tNo. I talked to them when they was asking me questions. Other than that ... I:\tWas it ever difficult for you to be in the program? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Why would you say that? R:\tHuh? I:\tWhy would say that was, that it wasn't difficult? R:\tBecause it reminded me when I was in high school. I:\tThe classes did? R:\tYeah. I:\tWere there any times where you were accused of violating the program? R:\tUh-hum [no]. I:\tNo, okay. Let's see. Do you know what that court date, the one you were telling me about, was regarding? R:\tIt was 8/1 but they said they was going to send me another letter out, but it goes to my auntie house. When I went to my auntie house, I haven't heard nothing, so I'm going to try to give them a call tomorrow. I:\tCan you explain how the program ended or how did you know--? R:\tI didn't know. I:\tI think for my clarification, how long after your arrest did you participate in the program? R:\tTwo days, a day or two after. I:\tThis has been going on for years? R:\tNo. I don't go to the program no more. I:\tOkay. No, I mean, you haven't known if you had it off your record yet? R:\tYeah, I don't know if it's off my record yet. I:\tTo what extent do you agree with the following; overall the program was very helpful? R:\tSomewhat. I:\tWas there anything particularly helpful about it? R:\tNo. I:\tWould you recommend it to others? R:\tJust overall helpful. I:\tOkay. And would you recommend it to other people? R:\tYeah. I:\tWere there any issues that you thought require addressing with how the program chooses clients? R:\tIt was cool. They talked to us. It was quite refreshing. I:\tDid the program prepare you to deal with any challenges after your participation ended? R:\tNo. I:\tNo, okay. Going back to the one week you spent in jail, what did you do the very first day after your release? R:\tHuh? I:\tGoing to back to the one week you spent at 850 Bryant, can you tell me about what you did the very first day you were out? R:\tWhat did I do when I first got out? I:\tYeah. R:\tI went home to my grandma's. Then was happy to be home. I:\tWhat was your first month like after that? R:\tOkay. It was okay.  [Interruption] I:\tHow'd you support yourself financially afterwards? R:\tWhat? What was that? I:\tHow did you support yourself financially after that? R:\tGA. I:\tWere you offered any programs regarding health care or counseling or treatment, something like that? R:\tUh-huh [no]. I:\tWere there any programs or services you would have wanted after your release? R:\tNo. I was going to get out of there and never come back. Never look back to the days I spent in jail. That's horrible to wish on my. I don't like jail. I wouldn't want nobody to go to jail. I don't see how these guys do it. For guns and stuff like that. I don't see how they do it because I couldn't even last a week in there, so I don't see how they can last a year. I don't see how they can do it. I:\tWould you say that your relationship with your family members changed for the better or for the worse? R:\tI don't know. They still the same. I:\tDid they provide you with any support, financial or housing, transportation? R:\tNo.  I:\tDid your detention affect your relationship with your friends? R:\tNo. I:\tDid they provide you with any support? R:\tNo. I:\tAbout how many places did you live the first year after your release? R:\tTwo. I:\tTwo, okay. How would you describe them? R:\tNo, I say three. I:\tThree, okay. Were they apartments or hotels? R:\tWhat was that? I:\tHow would you describe your housing situation, so did you live in an apartment or a house or ...? R:\tI lived in an apartment. I:\tWhat was it your apartment or your family or friends? R:\tIt was mine, no, my family's. I:\tCan you describe for me the pros and cons of living there at the time? R:\tThe who? I:\tThe pros and cons of living there at the time? R:\tIt was okay. It was okay. It wasn't [inaudible 24:26]. It was okay.  I:\tHow would you describe your living situation today? R:\tFabulous, wonderful, great. I:\tWhere do you live? In an apartment? R:\t[inaudible 24:41] Hill, apartment. I:\tAre there any cons to where you live now? R:\tUh-uh [no]. I:\tHave you had any trouble finding a place to live because of your contact with the criminal justice system? R:\tMm-hmm [yes]. I thought it was but it didn't matter. I:\tI'm going to read you some statement, again, and you can say strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree. In my first month out I felt my neighborhood was a safe place to live. R:\tWhere I'm at now? I:\tNo. Where you were right after your release. R:\tAgree. I:\tIn my first month out it was hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tDisagree. I:\tIn my first month out I was nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tDisagree. I:\tDrug selling was a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tNo. I:\tI think my neighborhood was a good place to live. R:\tAgree. I:\tI cared about what my neighbors thought of my actions. R:\tDisagree. I:\tIf there was a problem in my neighborhood, people who lived there could get it resolved. R:\tSomewhat. I:\tI expected to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tNow I'm going to read you some statements about where you live today. \tMy neighborhood is a safe place to live. R:\t[inaudible 26:32]. I:\tDisagree? R:\tAgree. I:\tIt is hard to stay out of trouble in my neighborhood. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI am nervous about seeing certain people in my neighborhood. R:\tDisagree. I:\tDrug selling is a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\tWho? I:\tDrug selling is a major problem in my neighborhood. R:\t[inaudible 26:59]. I:\tStrongly disagree? R:\t[inaudible 27:02]. I:\tI think my neighborhood is a good place to live. R:\tDisagree. I:\tI care about what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tWhat happened? I:\tI care about what my neighbors think of my actions. R:\tDisagree. I:\tIf there is a problem in my neighborhood, people who live there can get it resolved. R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\tI expect to live in this neighborhood for a long time. R:\tSomewhat agree. [Inaudible 27:43]. No. I:\tWith regard to housing, what are your future goals and how do you want to achieve that?

      "I:\tSo, before we get started on the interview, I just kind of want to go over some logistics first. I guess the first question is can you hear me okay? R:\tI can hear you perfectly. I:\tGreat. So the first thing is, would you be able to give me your address? We’re compensating our interviewees $40-- R:\tSo here’s what I’m going to ask you. I work [inaudible 1:26] program of recovery right now, and I see this as part of my service that I can make amends. I:\tOkay.  R:\tAnd I’d like you to donate that money, if you could really do this, is to The Safe House. The Safe House is actually a place in San Francisco that gets women off the street who have been in prostitution. If you could instead of giving it to me, if you guys could make a check out to them and give them money I would really appreciate it. I:\tThat’s really wonderful of you. Yes, I believe we’ve had other respondents ask the same, and I believe that that is possible. So I can talk with the lead researcher, and I will let you know. R:\tThat’s fine. I:\tWe do need to send you a consent form. I’m going to walk you through the consent form and ask for your verbal approval, but is there an address--either an email address or mailing address--that we can send a hard copy of the consent form to? R:\tYes. And nothing I say is going to have my name in it, right? I:\tThat’s correct. Yes. I’ll go through that in more detail. Yes. R:\t[gives address] I:\tGreat. So I’m going to walk you through the consent form right now. Feel free to stop me if you have any clarification questions. I’m just going to read it. Just ask me if you have any questions.  R:\t[Inaudible 3:13]. I:\tYou’re cutting out a little bit. R:\t[Inaudible 3:25]. I:\tThat’s fine. The other thing, too, is when we get to the interview--I don’t know if you have headphones or something; sometimes when folks have the phone on speaker it can be hard if we go ahead and record--if you give your permission for us to record.  R:\tI’m on a headset. [Inaudible 3:44]. I:\tGreat. So introduction and purpose. My name is Sandra Smith--Sandra Smith is not me, but she is the lead researcher--and I’m a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley in the department of Sociology. I would like to invite you to take part in my research study. I am interested in learning more about your experiences with the criminal justice system so that I can better understand the effects of diversion programs and pretrial detention. What I learn from this study might help to inform local and national conversations about reforms to the criminal justice system.  If you agree to participate in my research, I--or another trained researcher--will conduct an interview with you at the time of your choosing. The interview will involve questions about your experiences with the criminal justice system, and how you have fared personally, socially, and financially over the past few years.  Many questions have multiple choice responses, but there will be times when I will ask you to elaborate. The interview should last between an hour and a-half and two hours. With your permission the interview will be audio recorded using a digital recorder. The recoding is to accurately record the information you provide, and will be used for transcription purposes only.  If you choose not to be recorded, notes will be taken instead. If you agree to begin being recorded, but feel uncomfortable at any time, the recorder can be turned off at your request. And if you don’t want to continue, you can stop the interview at any time as well.  We expect to conduct only one interview. However, follow-ups may be needed for added clarification on any points you have made. If so, a member of our team will contact you by mail or phone.  And then a little bit about benefits. I do not expect you to experience any direct benefit from your participation in this study. My hope is that research findings will represent a contribution to our general knowledge of diversion programs and pretrial detention. If you’re interested, we are happy to share with you documents that are prepared based on the findings from this study.  And so because the interview includes questions on sensitive topics--such as experiences with the criminal justice system--there is a risk that you might become upset and/or feel uncomfortable. Some respondents may feel sadness or anger while sharing their experiences. You may, however, refuse to answer any of the questions posed during the course of this interview. And you may request that the recording be halted at any point. Your participation is completely voluntary. Furthermore, whether or not you choose to participate in the research--and whether or not you choose to answer a question or continue participating--there will not be any penalty to you or loss of the benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  Digital recordings are sent to a transcriptionist, so an additional risk is associated with a possible breach of confidentiality. In an attempt to ensure your confidentiality will not be breached by the transcriptionist, the transcriptionist will sign a confidentiality agreement.  So the last part is confidentiality.  R:\tThey will not have my address, right? I:\tThat’s correct. That is correct. That is kept with us only. And that will be destroyed, once we send you the confidentiality agreement. R:\tGot it. All right. I:\tSo you will be asked for signed consent, which we will send to you. And all of the information you provide will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used. As with all research, however, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised--however, I am taking precautions to minimize this risk. No actual names will be used in any published materials concerning the study. Your identity will be kept on a master list that is maintained by the researcher, and the transcript will be coded to protect privacy. R:\tThere is one thing. Do you have every word verbatim, or can you just [inaudible 7:37]? I feel uncomfortable with people reading word-for-word verbatim. I:\tYeah, that’s fair.  R:\tIf we’re going to do this, I just feel more comfortable … now, in the survey, I understand. You have to do that. But right now I’m just getting frustrated with this going word-for-word verbatim. I agree to what you’re saying. I believe in it. I am going to ask of you as well, is after we’re done--because I want to get my records sealed. I am going to ask you guys to send me a letter, saying, “[Name] participated in this. It was helpful.” Or something to that effect. I:\tOkay. R:\tThat’s what I’m asking. I:\tOkay, great. I think that won’t be a problem. [Interruption]  R:\tSorry about that; I just had a family thing I had to deal with. I:\tNo worries. Are you good to go? R:\tYes. Anyway, you can send [inaudible 11:07] after I’ve participated. Is that right? I:\tYes. I believe so. I don’t want to make any promises. I need to double-check that with the research director. But I have noted that and I will follow up with her. R:\tOkay, got it. So let’s go through the … I want to make this as quick as possible. I know it’s going to take an hour and a-half, but let’s cut through a lot of stuff. I’m okay with … I understand you’re going to try to protect my confidentiality as much as possible. There’s going to be a non-disclose by the person who is doing the transcript. Got it. Okay. I:\tWe’ll destroy the digital recordings of the interviews after the research. The only other thing I would say is that the transcripts or notes may be saved for future research, but they’ll be destroyed within … they’ll be kept for up to ten years and then destroyed. R:\tWhat is going to be kept? But it’s not going to have my name in, right? I:\tNo, no.  R:\tOkay. I:\tThe transcripts will have not your name. We’re coding them with non-identifiable things. R:\tAll right. That’s fine. I:\tGreat. So can you just give me verbal consent. R:\tYes. I:\tCool. And then verbal consent you’re okay with us recording. Is that correct? R:\tYes. I:\tOkay, great. Thank you so much. So because I am over the phone it’s harder to kind of … sometimes it can be harder, being conducted over the phone. So if you are kind of feeling like you need a break or anything, or a question anytime--just kind of flag it and let me know. R:\tOkay. I:\tLet’s begin with your current circumstances. I’m going to start with a few questions about your background, your relationships, and your experiences prior to, during, and following criminal justice contact. So starting with your background, the first questions is how old are you? R:\tYou’re cutting out, by the way. I:\tIs this better? R:\tIt sounds like it’s breaking up.  [Dealing with technical issues.] I:\tSo, how old are you? R:\tI’m 47. I:\tAnd then what day when you born? R:\tNovember 12th, 1969. I:\tWhere were you born? R:\tLowell, Massachusetts. I:\tAnd are you a US citizen? R:\tYes. I:\tWhat is your gender? R:\tMale.  I:\tAnd please choose from the list that I’m going to read to you the category or categories that best describe how you self-identify in terms of race. R:\tCaucasian. I:\tAnd please choose from this list how others perceive you in terms of race and ethnicity? R:\tCaucasian. Sorry. I don’t have a lot of patience for that shit. I:\tThat’s fine. And what is your present marital status? R:\tSingle. I:\tSingle, never married? R:\tSingle, never married. Correct. I:\tAnd how many children do you have? R:\tNone. I:\tAnd what is the highest level of education that you’ve completed? R:\tFour years of college. I:\tAnd then check all that apply. How do you support yourself financially; no support, job or jobs-- R:\tJob. I:\tSupport from family? R:\tNo. No support except for my job. I:\tOkay. About how much money do you earn?  R:\tI’m in sales, so I’d says on average about $300,000 [inaudible 15:45]. I:\tAnd that’s per year? R:\tIn the ballpark, yeah. I mean, it fluctuates a little bit. But yeah, in the ballpark. I:\tAnd so I would assume for the next question--what is your total household income--that you would fall into the category, then-- R:\tThe same. I:\tSo now we’re going to move to talk about a little bit about relationships and social support. I am going to read some statements that describe how you may feel about your current relationship with family. And to clarify, “family” means blood or legal relative and significant others, or guardians.  R:\tGot it. I:\tSo the first question is “I feel close to my family.” Strongly agree? Agree? Neutral? Disagree? Or strongly disagree? R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t“I want my family to be involved in my life.” R:\tStrongly agree. Not all of them. Not every member, but yes. [Laugh] I:\t[Laugh] R:\tNot [inaudible 16:45] family, so-- I:\tYes, yes. “I consider myself a source of support for my family.” R:\tHow do you define that? I:\tI mean, I guess it’s pretty open in terms of I guess it could be financial support, emotional support; but do you feel that you provide your family with any kind of support? R:\tEmotional support, I think. Yeah. I:\tOkay. And is that agree, or strongly agree? R:\tStrongly agree, yeah. I:\tAnd then, I guess on the flip side, do you feel your family is a source of support for you? Again, either financial or emotional? R:\tStrongly agree. Always going to be emotion[?] in that way. So I’d say strongly agree. I:\t“I fight a lot with my family members.” R:\tNo. Strongly disagree. I:\t“I often feel like I disappoint my family.” R:\tUmm … disagree. [Inaudible 17:56] one family [inaudible] family. It could be one person in the family that disagree … that you butt heads with. So I would say the other one would be disagree, as opposed to strongly disagree. Because [inaudible] family is all-encompassing. So all it takes is one bad apple and your family-- Anyway. Skew the results. I:\tAnd then the last question is, “I am criticized a lot by my family.” R:\tI am what? I:\tCriticized a lot by my family.  R:\tI’d say strong disagree. I’d say disagree. Disagree. There is one person in the family that’s kind of … anyway. I:\tAnd it sounds like for the most part you have a very good relationship, but then there are maybe one or two individuals you’re not as close to. R:\tWell, it’s a brother who is … he is also an addict. But he’s a dry drunk. So, yeah; you could surmise that. And I get along with them, to a degree. But he also … he can be … it’s like dealing with a child at times. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay. Thank you for elaborating. Again, we’re going to have the same scale here about your family. So then, “I have someone in my family I can count on to listen to me when I need to talk.” R:\tStrongly agree. I:\tAnd how many people would you say? R:\tUmm … I have a small family, so … I would say … three. I:\tOkay, and then, “I have someone in my family to turn to for advice about how to deal with a personal problem.” R:\tUmm, two. [Inaudible 19:50] two. [Laugh] I:\tAnd is that an agree or a strongly agree? R:\tUmm, I would say strongly agree. I:\tOkay. “I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a place to live.” R:\tUmm … agree. I:\tAnd then it’s going to be the same; how many? R:\tTwo. I:\t“I have someone in my family who would provide help or advice on finding a job.” R:\tI would say strongly agree, and I would say one. Well, advice that I would take. [Laugh] I would get a lot of advice, but the advice I would take would probably be from one of them. I:\tYes, okay; I can understand that. [Laugh] “I have someone in my family who would provide support for dealing with a health problem.” R:\tUmm, I would say--yeah, strongly agree. Two. I:\t“I have someone in my family who would provide transportation to work or other appointments if needed.” R:\tThey’re not … I’m in California and they’re not. So, zero. Disagree. I:\tBut if you were in the same geographic area? R:\tOh, yeah. I would say strongly agree. I would say three. If [inaudible 21:30] we’re all [inaudible]. [Inaudible.] Yeah. I:\tAnd then, “I have someone in my family who would provide me with some financial support if needed.” R:\tUmm … I’m trying to think about this. Agree. I would probably say one. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. All right. So going on to a little bit more deeper into those, family and friends can have an important source of support, but they can also be an influence on us to do things that are may not in our best interests, or kind of--as you alluded to-- some of the bad apples can be just a source of stress. So can you describe for me some relationships that you have with family and friends--both ones that you would consider a good, supportive relationship and then also one that you would consider bad, or destructive, or stressful? R:\tI don’t want to talk about that. I:\tOkay. That is more than fine. So then we’re moving to questions that are about relationships outside of your family. Can you think about three people to whom you feel closest personally, such as friends? And so again, this is outside of your family. R:\tThe one before was family? I:\tIt was family or friends. R:\tWell, with family I will answer that. That’s fine. I:\tOkay.  R:\tHow long will it take? I:\tThis is open-ended. You’re the driver here. R:\tA good relationship, I’d say my mom and my sister. It’s more of … the relationship has evolved. They know everything about my addiction, as does my brother. But they are more calm, and grounded. I can turn to them for things. I don’t really ask a lot of advice, but I can be very candid with them about things in my life. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tMy brother, we have some similarities. We’re both addicts. He’s been sober from drugs for a number of years, but he’s effectively a dry drunk [inaudible 24:02]. And that impacts the ability … you know, his emotional maturity is kind of stunted because of that. And it has impacted our relationship, you know?  I just started to establish boundaries, then, because … you know, some things he’s done I don’t agree with, and he doesn’t like it. [Inaudible 24:24], like training a dog. But it’s impacted. The boundaries are very helpful for me, and where I am in my recovery--that I just don’t [inaudible 24:35]. You know, whether he’s kind of abusive towards me, but if he’s talking negative about someone else in the family, I don’t want to hear it.  I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. I do not want to hear it. Not for nothing. I:\tSo it sounds like your mom and your sister are people that you feel like you can go to, to talk to. And your relationship with your brother is one that’s fine--but you’ve set up boundaries to kind of keep that relationship as … manageable. R:\tYeah, exactly. I would say that there’s a trust issue. I really don’t trust him. I don’t trust his intent on things. I think he has a good heart in there. When you’re an addictive mindset--the addiction not only … addition is not just the act of doing that behavior; it’s also the spirtual--or lack of spiritual--component in your life [inaudible]. So, any who. I:\tOne clarification question--and I apologize for my ignorance--but you’ve mentioned a few times; I think you’ve referred to your brother as a “dry drunk.” Can you explain what that means? R:\tYou never heard the term “dry drunk?” Do you have any alcoholics in your family? I:\tI do.  R:\tSo dry drunk--this is a common terminology--is somebody who might not be doing the act of using drugs or alcohol, or whatever it is. But their emotional maturity is that of a child. It’s like walking on eggshells around them.  I:\tOkay. R:\tThey behave … they might not be using. The addiction itself is about … the thing about it is the addiction itself is about the character defects and character flaws [inaudible 26:25] of doing it. Part of spiritual recovery is bringing a higher power--god--into your life. People who are dry drunks, they’re not doing that. They are the center of the universe. They control everything. It’s still very self-centered [inaudible 26:44]. The difference is that they not using drugs or alcohol [inaudible 26:49], right? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. Okay, thank you. Yeah, that makes sense in [inaudible 26:53] how you’re speaking to your relationship with your brother really makes sense in kind of filling that out as well. So, thank you for the clarification. R:\tYou’re welcome. I:\tSo we are going to start talking about relationships outside of your family. And it sounded like you weren’t comfortable with that. So I will-- R:\t[Inaudible 27:15] We can just go for [inaudible]. I:\tGreat. So how many friends--up to three, outside of your family--do you feel closest to? R:\tHow many? I:\tFrom zero to three, yeah. R:\tI would say four or five. I:\tAnd then we’re going to go through kind of-- If we could talk descriptively about three of your friends; not with names or anything. But if you have three friends in mind, for that third friend--is that friend a male or female? R:\tUmm, female. I:\tAnd then how would you describe her race or ethnicity? R:\tAsian. I:\tAnd then what is her age? R:\tUmm, mid-30s; mid, early 30s or something like that. And she is [inaudible 28:17] right now. I:\tAnd do you know what the highest level of education is that she has completed? R:\tUmm, four-year college I believe. I:\tAnd then do you know is she currently employed for pay? R:\tYeah. Very good job. I:\tI’m sorry; I cut you off--you were saying something about her education? R:\tShe might have a graduate degree. I’m not sure. I:\tOkay, and do you know if she is receiving any public aid? R:\tNo, she makes very good money. I:\tOkay. And is she married or living with a partner? R:\tNo. She’s single. I:\tAnd then the same set of questions for that second friend. Is it male or a female? R:\tI would say … I have probably seven, eight friends. But I don’t want to go through all of them. I:\tWe’re just going through three. R:\tThe second one would be a guy. The exact same thing; he supports himself. No public aid. Four-year college. I:\tOkay. And then what would you say is his age? R:\tUmm, early 40s? I:\tOkay. And then, again, race and ethnicity? R:\tWhite.  I:\tAnd then is he married or living with a partner? R:\tSingle. Single. And then the third one would be retired, collecting pension. Maybe social security, I think. Married.  I:\tAnd is that a male or female? R:\tMale, sorry.  I:\tNo worries. R:\tCaucasian. I:\tOkay, great. Thank you.  I:\tSo now we’re moving away from friends. I’m going to ask you some questions about groups and organizations you may be part of, and whether you receive support from those groups--either material or emotional. R:\tThis connection really sucks. It’s distracting. I:\tThank you for letting me know. [Technical difficulties.] [*end SF657, part 1 - begin SF657, part 2*]  [Note: timestamps restart at 00:00] I:\tIs this any better? R:\tNot really. But I don’t want to do this all night. I:\tOkay. At any point you can stop me and then we can schedule another time. Very weird. R:\tThere’s no intent behind it. It’s just the way it is. Anyway, let’s go. I:\tOkay. So we’re going to talk about some of your affiliations, and then talking about whether you feel like you’ve received emotional or material supports. So emotional support, you know-- R:\tThere’s no material support. We can get that out of the way. I:\tSo then we can talk, I guess, just in terms of emotional supports. I’m going to walk through a few organizations and you’re going to let me know if you participate in them. So the first is church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious-- R:\tNot in many, many years. I:\tOkay. Recreational club? R:\tNo. I:\tSports team? R:\tNo. I:\tMusic or artist group? R:\tUmm, no. I:\tCrew or a gang? R:\tWhat? I:\tLike, a crew or a gang? R:\t[Laugh] No gang affiliation for [inaudible 2:07].  I:\tAny local government group? R:\tNo. I:\tCivic associations? R:\tThere’s no groups I belong to, except … just to make it easy for you. There’s no groups I belong to. The only thing I am part of is a 12-step program for my sex addiction. I:\tOkay, great. Thank you. And how often do you participate in this support group? R:\tWeekly I go to … I don’t call it a support group. It’s a 12 … well-- I:\tOkay. R:\tIt’s a 12-step program. I:\tIt’s a program. Okay. R:\tI don’t like the word “support.” If you put it under the category of recovery program, 12-step recovery program. I:\tOkay. R:\tI go to meetings probably two to three times a week. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And so do you feel like you are able to turn to this group for emotional support? R:\tYes. I:\tAnd you said not for financial support.  R:\tCorrect. I:\tDo you feel comfortable elaborating about some of the emotional support you feel like you can receive from the group or have received in the past? R:\tUmm, yeah. They have an intimate relationship [inaudible 3:19] emotional [inaudible] talk about things that come up for me, being an addict. I mean, additionally, vice-versa; they’re people I can relate to because they have the same commonalities I do, which is … they’ve had an unmanageability around their sex addiction. So we share the commonality. A 12-step program is not a support group; it’s [inaudible 3:45]. I:\tOkay. R:\tIt’s a spiritual foundation, a process for recovery. I:\tOkay. And it sounds like what you’re saying is not only are you able to receive support from them, but since it’s a shared experience that you’re able to provide support as well. So it’s kind of a two-way [inaudible 4:05] relationship. R:\tCorrect. Right. I mean, the way a 12-step program works is you have the program, and then you have the fellowship. The program itself is kind of the framework of recovery; the 12 steps that you work through with a sponsor. And then the fellowship is kind of … basically the people inside it that you communicate with. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\t[Inaudible 4:28]. We [inaudible]. I:\tOkay. Great, thank you. R:\tYou’re welcome. I:\tSo we’re hopping around again. So a few questions about your employment history. R:\tHmm-hmm [yes].  I:\tSo how old were you when you had your first job? R:\tUmm … first job … 14. I:\tAnd how much of your adult life would you you’ve been employed–all, most-- R:\tAll. I was unemployed for brief periods of time. Very short periods of time. But yeah, I’ve been employed my whole time.  I:\tAnd can you just briefly describe what skills you bring to the labor market, and how you? R:\tI mean, I’m in sales, and-- I:\tOkay. R:\tAnd in sales, the essence of that is going to be communication.  I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tHow did I learn that? Just from … I’m a social person. I mean, I’m a social person. I think it’s interpersonal skills, and … you know, things come in ebbs and flows in terms of [inaudible 5:44].  I:\tAnd are there other skills that you’re--for your current job, I guess, or maybe future that you are trying to learn now or that you’re hoping to learn in the future? R:\tNot particularly. I mean, you know what? Possibly. I do photography on the side. I:\tOh, cool. R:\tAnd eventually-- Oh, that’s my passion. I [inaudible 6:07] connect to art galleries. If I could eventually monetize that, I would do that in a heartbeat. I:\tYeah. R:\tBut I’m not going to hold my breath. If I had somebody who is connected who could make introductions for me, I would. But I just need to put together a portfolio. So I would say that skill, in terms of that would be a skill--learning how to continue to do things with photography. I’m very creative, but I can always get better in what I do. So a skillset in terms of outside of what I do on a day-in, day-out basis. I:\tThat’s really cool. I would imagine that this … The friends I have in the sales world, it’s very intense and can be stressful. So I imagine having a creative outlet is a nice balance to that, to your nine-to-five day. R:\tYeah. I’m passionate about health and fitness. I work out a lot. And I’m also passionate about photography. I have a regular camera with very nice lenses, but I do most of my pictures candidly, during the day or during the week. Or on my phone. I have the iPhone 7 Plus, which is awesome. I:\tI’ve heard that that’s pretty amazing. That’s cool. That’s awesome. I wish you the best of luck with that. R:\tThanks. I appreciate it. I:\tI’m going to walk you through a few possible barriers to employment and just ask you to tell me if any of these have ever occurred; if you’ve ever faced any of these in terms of barriers to employment. The first is education, training, or experience? R:\tNo. I:\tTransportation? R:\tNo. I:\tFamilial obligations? R:\tNo. I:\tLack of available jobs? R:\tUmm, when I’ve been laid off … yeah. I mean, I wasn’t laid off for long, but available jobs that I liked. [Laugh] There is a bit of a caveat to that. I:\tSo available jobs that were in your interest area and where your skills are. That makes sense. Employer discrimination? R:\tNo. I:\tCriminal record? R:\tNo. I:\tSubstance abuse? R:\tNo. I:\tDomestic violence? R:\tNo. I:\tMental and/or physical health? R:\tNo. I:\tHomeless/housing instability? R:\tNo. I:\tAny others that I didn’t cover? R:\tNo. But I would say that I did lose a job indirectly because--two jobs. I believe, indirectly, because of my addiction. So I don’t know if that would classify in any of your categories. Not directly, but more indirectly. Indirectly. Not directly. I:\tDo you feel comfortable elaborating on what you mean by indirect? R:\tWhen I lived in Boston, I was in my addiction--before I really started working the program. I was just angry. I would stay up late. While I wasn’t using a physical substance, the sex addiction--the chemicals in your body. I acted like a child. Eventually I got fired, because I just blew up at somebody. And I would say that the other one, I was … you know, I think I wasn’t as productive as I could have been because I was in my addiction, frankly. So I think that would be accurate. I:\tThe addiction is affecting how you perform at work. R:\tIt did. I:\tAnd work performance is kind of what determines if you’re keeping a job or not. Yeah, I think that that’s pretty-- R:\tI’m not saying that the results would have been different, but I think I would have had better results had I not been in the addiction. I:\tGreat. Thank you for sharing. And you said you work in sales. Do you have just one job? R:\tI have one. I:\tAre then are you comfortable sharing what your current job title is? R:\tVice-president. It’s a generally baseless[?] title. I:\tAnd then when did you begin that job? R:\tMy existing? I:\tYes. R:\tMy existing … existing job I started in 2012. I:\tI assume that it’s full-time? R:\tCorrect. I:\tAnd then did you find this job?  R:\tReferral. Referral through a former colleague. Through LinkedIn. It was from a former colleague. He got it through LinkedIn. I:\tAnd you already said that you earn about $300,000 a year. R:\tIn that ballpark. I:\tWe’ve already answered these questions. I’m going to skip ahead. Is the job that you currently have now--is that typical of what you’ve been doing in the past? Have you been working in sales previously at this high a level? R:\tYes. I:\tCan you just give me a general overview of the types of jobs you’ve had, and your experience in the job market--and the type of work you’ve done prior to this job? R:\tI’ve had other sales jobs. I mean, I started off in service when I graduated from college. I’ve had jobs for a long time, for the most part. I:\tYes; since 14 I believe you said. R:\tYeah. But I would say after college I’ve had jobs for a long time. One company I was at for I think four years. The next one I was at for three. The next one for eleven. And then this one. I mean, there really haven’t been many. I:\tIt sounds like you keep, I feel like. That’s not the generational thing everyone has; 11 years, that’s great. You don’t hear that as much these days. R:\tDepending on the field you work in and the industry. I mean, tech--these people don’t stay as long, probably. In perpetuity. I:\tCan you tell me about what you would consider your most positive work experience, and what made that experience so positive? R:\tMy most positive work experience was when I … the job before this. Well, the same company, but initially when I got to the company, for several years it was a start-up within a big company. And it was a product that was incredibly innovative. It was amazing. It basically became a Harvard case study. I:\tThat’s cool. Wow. R:\tIt was pretty amazing. I:\tThat’s amazing, to be a part of that. R:\tAbsolutely. I completely agree. I:\tThat’s really cool. And on the flip side, can you tell me about your most negative work experience? R:\tYeah. I’m trying to think. My most negative one I think was doing customer service. I got very burnt out doing it. That’s also when I got fired. I was unhappy doing it. I had done it for too long. I:\tYou referred to that job earlier as well in the interview. Correct? R:\tYeah. I:\tIs there anything else you want to add about your work? R:\tNot really. I travel. My last two jobs--two, three--I’ve traveled with them. I traveled, which can be exhausting. Being exhausted is for many addicts what is called a trigger. That puts you at a place of being in discomfort, and we’re looking for comfort. I need to be in a spiritually grounded place, and get rest when I’m like that. I:\tYou said your previous jobs involved a lot of travel. Does that mean you’re not traveling as frequently with your current job? R:\tI’m choosing not to. I really don’t need to do that as much. Although just recently I just made the decision [inaudible 15:54] business where I’m at right now, and from a sanity standpoint. I:\tThat’s good. Great. Now we’re moving on about asking you questions about experiences you’ve had with substance abuse, if any. R:\tNone. None. I:\tThat’s what I thought. So let me skip those. And now I’m going to ask you some questions about your mental and/or emotional health. Again, these are all going to be kept private. You don’t have to answer anything that you’re not comfortable with. R:\tSounds good. I:\tHave you ever been told by a mental health professional that you have a mental or emotional condition or that you show symptoms of a mental or emotional condition? R:\tNo. Not outside of my addiction. No. I:\tIs your addiction diagnosed by a professional? R:\tOh, yeah. I:\tWhat was your diagnosis? R:\tSex addiction. I:\tSo in addition to that addiction, have you ever yourself thought you’ve had an emotional or a mental health condition that was not diagnosed? R:\tNo. I:\tHave you ever taken medicine prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of an emotional or mental condition? R:\tSorry. I’m munching on food. I:\tNo, you’re fine. R:\tYes. Here’s the thing. The only condition I had, I still have. I was diagnosed when I was probably 14 or 15 with Tourette’s. My psychologist [says?] that impacts my addiction. It’s part of Tourette’s impulsivity.  For me, I did take medication for it until four or five years ago. It just made me tired. And the Tourette’s has lessened as I’ve gotten older. I also took medication for depression [and for?] ADD. I stopped taking it altogether, because I don’t really think I had those conditions. I think it was more … I mean, maybe I have borderline ADD. But the side effects of all these things was … it wasn’t worth the … Drug companies love you to take them, right? So they don’t legalize marijuana. By the way, on a side note, I don’t smoke weed. But drug companies and alcohol companies are the ones, basically, who are against legalizing marijuana because it takes money away from them. That’s a side note. I don’t smoke. Anyway. People who are using that, they’re not going to be taking stuff for depression. Go figure. I:\tThat’s interesting, and not something that’s in the discourse that’s around legalization at all. R:\tIf you do a Google for it, maybe you’ll find the drug companies or the amount of drug sales that have fallen in states that have legalized marijuana. I:\tThat’s super-interesting. I’m definitely going to look into that. Thank you. R:\tYou’re welcome. I:\tThen, the next question is have you ever been admitted to a mental hospital, unit, or treatment program where you’ve stayed overnight because of an emotional or mental condition? R:\tNo. I:\tThen have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained professional? R:\tYes. I see a psychologist now. I:\tIs that a helpful-- R:\tVery helpful. Very helpful. I get more out of it in the space that I’m in now. Being in the addiction itself, it’s somewhat helpful--but you get more out of it when you’re present and not in an unconscious state, as Eckhart Tolle would say. So when I’m present I get a lot more out of everything that I do. I:\tDid you self-elect to go to counseling? Or is this court-ordered, or required under your program? R:\tSelf-elected. Self-elected. I:\tHow long have you been in therapy? R:\tA long time. A long, long time. I mean, since I was a kid. I:\tThe next question, it says do you feel like you have an emotional or mental health condition now? And so you’ve talked about your addiction. Is there anything else? R:\tNo. I [inaudible 21:17] it anymore. I think you have some insanity when you’re in your addiction, candidly. I:\tCan you talk a little bit about how you’ve seen your emotional or mental concerns change over the years? You talked a little bit about your Tourette’s and your medication. Is there any other change you’ve seen over the course of your life? R:\tI grew up also with a learning disability, too. I’d put that in there as well. I would just say that I think over the course of time I’ve adjusted to having a learning disability, I have learning comprehension. So I probably have to slow down and just stop and read and take notes. I’m a visual person in many ways. That’s what I’d say. I:\tIs there anything else on the topic of mental and emotional health you want to add or talk more about? R:\tNot really. The other thing is from a physical standpoint just … I’m not sure if we’re going to get to it. I had testicular cancer 17 years ago. I:\tI’m sorry to hear that. R:\tNo, it’s fine. I:\tWow. I’m sure that was very difficult. R:\tIt was not easy. Looking back on it, I think I was going through denial that pertained to myself. But it was a lot. When I look back on it. It was a traumatic experience. I:\tYeah. Wow. Are you in remission now? R:\tYeah. Now I’m cured; 17 years ago. I:\tThat’s good. That must have been very difficult to deal with. R:\tIt was not easy. No. I:\tThen we’re going to move to the next section, which is we’re going to talk about experiences with the criminal justice system. And first, with starting about learning more about interactions that you may have had with the police. As with some of the others, again, these are sensitive and emotional and you’re not required to answer anything. Please stop me at any point. R:\tBefore you do that, I’ll let you know that through the grace of something bigger than me, I went through first-time offenders program twice. So I was arrested twice over I think 12 years between the two things; 11 or 12 years between the two things. The courts allowed me to go through it a second time. I:\tYou were an adult at both of those arrests? R:\tYeah. I:\tOr was one you were a juvenile? R:\tNo. Adult. I:\tWhat were the specific offenses for which you were arrested? R:\tSolicitation. I:\tBoth times. Correct? R:\tYeah. Correct. I:\tAnd then how old were you at the time of your first arrest? R:\tI was 31 or 32. The second one would be 44, 45. Something like that. I:\tAnd then can you describe for me the event of your arrest, from the moment you were approached by officers, and then taken into custody--and then walking through arraignment, assuming you were arraigned. R:\tNo. I was never. Are you smoking a cigarette, by the way? I:\tYeah. R:\tI can tell. I:\tOh, you asked if I was. Oh, no. I’m not. R:\tYou’re not? It sounded like you were. Never mind. I:\tI thought you were asking my permission. I was like, “Sure.” R:\tNo, no. I don’t smoke. I have very sensitive hearing, so I pick up everything. Sorry. I’m quirky like that.  There were two times I was arrested. The first time, I was soliciting somebody on the street, whatever. Yeah. I was soliciting someone. Then I was handcuffed. I was handcuffed and walked down to … It was a sting operation. Both of these situations were sting operations. I had walked to a parking lot. They told me about most likely going to a first-time offenders program. This was back in 2011 or 2012. One of the two.  And then, the second time … and the police were fair both times. They were not abusive in any way, shape, or form. I was in my program to begin with at the time. This was in relapse. I was never arraigned. There was no arraignment. I could either contest it--which I would have gone to court--or I would have the charges dropped if I went to the first-time offenders program, which I went through twice.  And the first time was soliciting someone in the street. The second one was going to a hotel after contacting someone through Backpage[?]. They’re no longer doing their ads anymore. But contacting people that way. [Inaudible 26:46] sting operation in the hotel room and I was just … Yeah. That’s what happened. I:\tYou said that the police treated you fairly. R:\tYes. I:\tJust give me what makes you feel like they treated you fairly? If you can describe that. R:\tThe first time, I can’t really remember. But they weren’t going, “You fucking idiot.” They were not abusive. Second time, I was distraught. I was just I fucked up; I am so sorry. This was where I was at. And I broke down. And they were just like--no, it’ll be okay. Don’t worry. There are worse things you could have done. So they were somewhat empathetic. Not empathetic, but … I mean, I still broke the law, of course. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. So were you taken into custody? Were you held in jail? R:\tNo. No. No. Not this time. I:\tSo you were not booked. So they released you after taking you into custody, but never booking you. R:\tRight. The charges were dropped. Arrest, but no charges. I:\tThen, sorry, to confirm, you’ve never actually been convicted? R:\tNo. I:\tBecause of the court diversion program. R:\tThey were showing as arrests. I had an attorney change them to detainments. Now it’s detainments. And then there are a couple things I’m doing, and then he’s going to get the record sealed. We’re working to try to get the record sealed. I:\tThere may be a question about this later, too, but did you have a private lawyer or did you have a public defender? R:\tPrivate. I:\tIs there anything else you want to say about that? About your arrests? R:\tNo. There’s not much to say about it. They were fair. I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to go through the first-time offenders program, rather than just being booked. If it happened in any other place, a lot of other places I wouldn’t have been as fortunate. Also, the fact that I was able to go through the first-time offenders program twice. I was extremely fortunate. I:\tThose were both in San Francisco? R:\tCorrect. I:\tAnd just in terms of … they released you upon the kind of everything is dropped based on the assumption that you go through and complete the program? That if something-- R:\tYou have to complete the program. And then that’s when officially the charges are dropped, basically. The second time I also had to go to the community thing, and basically sit down with people from the community and write out the impact that my addiction has on the community and [inaudible 29:59]. I:\tCan you explain what is the “community” that you were … can you explain a little bit more about what that process was like? R:\tThe community was just people who happened to live in a certain area. They basically got together. It was more formalized than the first time I went through it. The first time, there was not [inaudible 30:22]. But then this time it was kind of a community; just people who lived in the neighborhood or they volunteered. They talked about the impact of this and they wanted me to write something about the impact of prostitution and trafficking. In other words, writing a report on what I’ve learned about the impact of prostitution on everybody. I:\tHow was that experience for you? R:\tIt was good. I think it’s important to go through, candidly. I:\tWhy? Can you explain a little bit on why you think it’s important? R:\tWell, I think it’s important to recognize the impact our addiction has on people. I:\tGreat. That’s helpful. Thank you. So, the same as with law enforcement. I’m going to ask you some questions … I am going to read you some statements and ask you to describe how you may feel about legal authorities. And so again, this is going to be the scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. “I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.” R:\tImpacting me or impacting everybody else? What’s the context? I:\tIt’s up to your interpretation. I read this, “I feel that I should accept the decisions made by legal authorities.” R:\tI, personally. I:\tPersonally. Yeah. R:\tWell, only as it pertains to me, I would say most of the time--yes. From my experience, yes. I do. That’s just my experience. But I think legal authorities make mistakes. Absolutely. Because they’re human beings. They’re going to make mistakes. I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. And so for you, personally, you said maybe somewhat agree? Or strongly agree? R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\tThen, if you’re talking about the broader global context, it would maybe be-- R:\tFor me, it would be strongly agree. And the global context, agree. I:\tOkay. “People should obey the law, even if it goes against what they think is right.” R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t“It is difficult to break the law and keep one’s self-respect.” R:\tCompletely agree. Totally agree. Whatever that falls into. Sorry. I:\tCan you elaborate a little bit there? R:\tYou’ve just got to do what’s right. What I mean by that is if you’re doing something that violates your basic … How can you feel good about yourself--unless you really compartmentalize things--if you do things that go against a true self[?]? It’s going to … I can speak for myself. It impacts my self-esteem and how I feel about myself. I:\tI understand that. “The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of people like me.” R:\tPeople in power. Yeah. Strongly agree. I:\t“People in power use the law to control people like me.” R:\tAgree. I:\tSomewhat agree or strongly agree? R:\tSomewhat agree. I:\t“The law does not protect my interests.” R:\tDisagree. I:\tStrongly or somewhat? R:\tSomewhat. I:\t“Most police in my city do their job well.” R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t“Most police in my city treat people with respect.” R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t“The basic rights of citizens in my city are well-protected by police.” R:\tStrongly agree. I:\t“The police in my city have too much power.” R:\tStrongly disagree. I:\tAnd, “most police in my city treat some people better than others.” R:\tI don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say to that. I would say … I don’t know what to say to that. It would be incorrect for me to … And I think for all the police … I’m just doing it based on my own inherent knowledge or bias. I:\tI can put you down for neither agree nor disagree. R:\tCool. I:\tCool. It seems like overall of kind of positive feelings, at least in your personal experience, about law enforcement and the way that they both conduct themselves and their governing. And how they’re operated. But then you also expressed some concerns about power; the people in power dictate what the laws are, which may, from what I would infer from what you said, may sometimes be in line with your values but maybe sometimes may not. Is that the correct summation of your answering? R:\tI think that’s fair to say. I:\tGreat. Have you ever been unfairly stopped, searched, questions, physically threatened, abused, or otherwise treated inappropriately by the police? R:\tNo. I:\tI’m not turning my pages as fast. To what extent and how do you think race has shaped your experience with the police? R:\tWhat do you mean? Should I say “agree,” “strongly disagree”? I:\tNo. It’s just open-ended. To what extent, and how? Then if you can explain how you think race has affected your interactions with the police. R:\tI’m white, so I don’t think it’s impacted me at all. I don’t have probably the inherent biases a lot of people would, based on my own experiences per se. I:\tYou said you don’t have inherent biases? Or the police don’t have inherent biases towards you? Which--? R:\tI think they don’t have inherent biases towards me if they’re white. I would say that, yeah. That’s what I would say. How much longer do we have, by the way? I’m getting really tired. I:\tWe still have a decent amount of questions. R:\tI’m not going to be able to get through the whole of this. I:\tOkay. R:\tI can give you another ten minutes. I:\tUnderstandable. Let’s just move on. You were not detained pretrial. R:\tNo. I:\tThat is correct. Actually, we can skip a bunch of those. Sorry. I’m just trying to move through. So was your diversion program considered neighborhood court? R:\tYes. Yes. Yes. The second time. I:\tHow long is the neighborhood court program that you were in? R:\tA month. How long? I went and met once. I talked to them. Then I came back and I read the paper to them. That was it. I:\tThen, following your arrest, how did you support yourself financially? R:\tI still had a job. I:\tI want to ask you a bit about access to programs or services that you maybe had after your arrest and whether you found them helpful. R:\tThe only one I used was my program. That’s it. That’s the only program. I don’t want to be wasting your time. It’s the only program. I:\tIs there anything else you wish you had had in terms of access to services, or other things in addition to your program, post-arrest? R:\tUmm … The only other thing might be to … understanding about … I think the only [thing] is understanding about getting charges reduced or getting them eliminated. It was kind of gray. Getting things expunged. They talked about that very broadly, but I think it was not very clear. I:\tI was going to say, so kind of, because you were talking about going through the expungement process--and it sounds like most of that you’re doing on your own. R:\tRight. Mine is not going to be expunged. It’s going to become sealed. I don’t know what that’s called, when it’s sealed. I:\tBut that was not something that was covered. And also, post-arrest, can you tell me about your initial interactions with your family members? R:\tThey didn’t know about it. I:\tOkay, so it hasn’t affected your relationship with your family, since they didn’t know. R:\tRight. I:\tAlso, I guess, the same with friends. Were there friends that knew? And did this effect your relationship with friends? R:\tThe only people that knew were people in my program, and it did not impact it. I:\tYou do not have children. And it sounds like you were living in your same house and apartment. R:\tYeah. I:\tYour housing situation did not change. R:\tRight. I:\tI can skip through all of these housing. I guess maybe, I know since you only have a few minutes, can you just broadly talk about how you feel about your neighborhood that you live in? Is it a safe place to live? R:\tExtremely safe. I:\tDo you feel like it’s ... Is it hard to stay out of trouble in your neighborhood? R:\tHere’s the thing; I can get into trouble anywhere. So it’s not the neighborhood. I would say that your spiritual state is what impacts the quality of your sobriety. Neighborhood is immaterial. I would say if I lived in Tenderloin … I live in the Marina. But in the Tenderloin it might be a little different. But I would say in my existing spiritual state I’m not … I haven’t had thoughts of wanting to medicate with sex in over two months. I:\tOkay. Then I want to ask you a few questions. Again, you’re in power here; tell me when you’re done. About your experience in neighborhood court from the moment you entered the courtroom until you were dismissed. R:\tI never went to a courtroom. We can skip those. There’s no courtroom. No court. I:\tThat community program that you explained is basically you were-- R:\tIt wasn’t a court. It was in lieu of court. I never went to court. I:\tYou walked me through what the proceedings were like. It was members of the community. How it made you feel. R:\tExactly. Yeah. I:\tGreat. Was there any supervision component of neighborhood court? R:\tNo. I don’t think so. I:\tSo you weren’t reporting to anyone while you were going through the process. It was more just making sure you would show up. R:\tThey were reporting whether I showed up or not. I:\tIs there any [inaudible 44:07]? I know you talked about you thought it was important to share here how-- R:\tThey sent me. They suggested I do this. That was [inaudible busted me. I:\tIn terms of if there’s any other benefits from the program, from participating? I know you spoke about talking about this and hearing from the community members. Any personal relationship? I’m guessing not education or employment, but any other benefits? R:\tNo. No. No, no, no. I:\tWere there any negative consequences associated with your participation? R:\tNo. None. None. I:\tThen, can you tell me a little bit about the program, the other program for first offense? Did you get to know anyone as a result of being in the program? R:\tThere was not a program. It wasn’t a … I didn’t meet any other people who were arrested. I did not meet anybody else in the program. People who were in the first-time offenders program, I didn’t talk to anybody. I:\tYou did not talk to anybody? R:\tNo. I:\tIs there anything you can say about staff of either the first-time offenders or the neighborhood court that you interacted with most? Were you actually interacting with staff as part of that? R:\tMinimally. I:\tIt doesn’t sound like anyone influenced your participation. R:\tNo. No. I:\tWas it ever difficult to be in the program? R:\tIt was uncomfortable. I don’t want to say it was difficult. It was just uncomfortable. I:\tCan you explain a little bit? R:\tBecause of the degree of shame. You’re there for a reason. You violated the law, so I think there’s a degree of probably shame that comes up. I:\tWere you ever accused of violating the conditions of the program? R:\tNo. No. No. No. Nope. I:\tI think you said earlier, but completion of the program was … You completed the program successfully, which was determined by completing that community meeting. Is that correct? R:\tYeah. Plus going to the first-time offenders program. There were two parts of it. I:\tHow did they notify you that you were done? Did you get anything formal? R:\tWhen you went through everything, you just got a little note saying I basically completed bla-bla-bla. I:\tThe charges were dismissed but the arrest was still on your record. R:\tIt was changed to a detainment, because of me getting an attorney. I:\tOkay. There are just maybe two or three more very quick ones. To what extent do you agree with the following? “Overall, the program was very helpful.” R:\tAgree. I:\tJust agree, not strongly agree? R:\tI would say strongly agree, just for shits and giggles. I:\t[laugh] And is there something that you can say in addition to what you said already about why you felt it was particularly helpful? Or if there was any particularly unhelpful or counterproductive parts? R:\tNone of this stuff got me sober. This program, if you’re not an addict, it might help you. If you’re an addict, maybe it helps you. It’s helpful in the extent as understanding the impact that our actions have on the community. It’s helpful to understand that. What I would say is, if someone is in denial about it, they’re probably going to think it’s horrible. For me, I realized exactly what I did. I know that I fucked up. That didn’t get me sober, in either case. It’s been a long, painful path for me to get to where I’ve got to. I:\tFrom what you’ve talked about from the group you’re in, and I forget the term that you used, the 12-step group, but that’s where you’ve gotten most of your support, as opposed to the neighborhood court program. R:\tWell, I mean it’s helpful information. I think I understand what they’re trying to do. And I’m glad they do it, because some people will do that and never get arrested again. Not only get arrested; but they’ll never do the activity again. I believe that a lot of people who do it are addicts and probably don’t stop doing it unless they … That’s my belief [inaudible 49:09]. Unless they get to a place where they’re ready to work a program as a spiritual recovery. For me, personally, I’m actually … it’s kind of coincidental you called today. Tomorrow I’m actually participating in the program. I’m actually speaking. I:\tGreat. R:\tTo my program. We have people come in there, and speak about [inaudible 49:36] and what we’ve been through. And that’s what I’m doing, and talking about our program as well from a different perspective than I experienced before. I’m grateful I had the opportunity to do that [inaudible 49:51]. And 99 percent of the people either A; are an addict, or, B; are not ready yet if they are. You know? I would say most people … I believe, most people who pay for sex, it’s not a one-time thing. Although I could be wrong. But I would say 99 percent of the people are not ready to recover if they are addicts. And then hopefully [inaudible 50:18]. That’s it. I:\tI think the ten minutes is probably up. Is there anything else that you didn’t have the chance to say that you think is important to make sure you convey? R:\tWhat else do you need to know? Let me just ask you. If you could summarize other things without going through every question, what else do you need to know? I:\tThis is my very first interview, so I’m not as familiar with the docket, so I can’t run through it as quickly. I apologize. Were there any challenges? Anything specific about the program that you think either set you up for success, set you up for failure? From staffing, from the process itself, and if there are just other things that, in terms of your experience going through this program, how that kind of affected you in your life today. R:\tWell, I had it probably … a little different for me than probably other people, because I knew I was a sex addict when I was arrested both times. It was not a surprise to me. I would say that because … I thought it was very good talking, talking about the impact that it has on people in society. I think it’s very important doing that. I believe that. That’s me, personally. It was good knowledge for me. It was. I won’t say it wasn’t. It was. Now, did I know all that stuff? No. I didn’t. Did that help get me sober? No. Because I’m an addict. So I had to hit my bottom before I got to a place of where I’m at now. So you know, it’s been my addiction. I’ll just be very candid with you. My addiction was paying for sex from … Then, when I got arrested the first time, I’m like--I’m never going to solicit anyone on the street again. I’m just going to use Backpage or whatever. No problem. I’m just going to tell you my quick story, just so you understand. I’ve been through a lot with my life and my addiction. My addiction led to me going to a hotel and getting beaten up by a pimp, in addition to getting arrested twice. Then going to--okay. I’m not going to go to a hotel. I’m going to have people come to me. So I wasn’t getting arrested. I got beaten up by a pimp. I got robbed at the same time. It’s the nature of the addiction. It takes you a lot of places. Not some places, but places nonetheless.  Then I would say that I went to a place the last couple years where I’m not using the newspapers but then going to sugar daddy websites. Which was the same thing. It was manipulating young women who were in college who had, because of college, who had a lot of debt. Basically do what I wanted. Lying to them, telling them that I wanted something ongoing when I didn’t. Having them believing and feeling that it wasn’t transactional, but [inaudible 54:01] transactional. I would have unprotected sex with a lot of women. I’d give them a lot of money. I was [inaudible 54:05] them.  For me, ultimately, that was my bottom. I felt so [inaudible 54:10] about myself and everything that I was doing, manipulating. For me, it didn’t feel … I was like, it’s different than Backpages; these aren’t really full-time prostitutes. No, they weren’t. These are people basically who probably were, I imagine, were abused probably sometime in their life. Any woman who turns to selling their body probably has been abused some time in their life. That’s what happens. Maybe they have never been sexually abused, but they’ve had some sort of abuse. They have to, to get to this point. There has to be some sort of self-esteem … People don’t [inaudible 54:52] really high self-esteem, who sell their body.  That was my bottom, which I needed to hit. I eventually got to finally a place of really seeing the impact it had on these women. I’m sure it had on other people, but especially for the women who are not full-time prostitutes. But it’s still prostitution. I’m still paying for something. I was getting something. [Inaudible 55:19]. Anyway. That wasn’t part of the thing, but I just wanted to add context to how I got to where I got to today. I:\tThank you. I really appreciate you sharing that. I know it probably can be difficult to share. But I do appreciate it. The last thing is just if there’s any feedback you have--either for me; I guess questions, one, if there’s any feedback you have in terms of what we talked about today. They’re obviously sensitive, and can be sensitive and uncomfortable. Do you have any suggestions for how we might ask these questions more effectively? Or just make the process better? We welcome any feedback you have. R:\tI would say for you, it’s your first time going through it, which I understand. Group the questions together. Ad that you need to kind of say … framing it out and saying, “I have eight sets of questions. These are what they deal with.” Frame it out. I’m a control freak, so it helps me to know how many sets of questions you have. I:\tThat makes sense. R:\tThe other thing is, understand, especially if they’re not “agree, strongly, agree,” if they’re freeform, is understanding what the questions are. You could ask me; hey, this one is dealing with this--tell me about these kinds of things. I:\tOkay. Thank you. That’s super-helpful. And I appreciate your patience. I know it is a long interview, and it is my first time. I really appreciate your patience. R:\tYou got me on a good day. I’m an inpatient person. You got me on a good day. I’m just tired. I get grumpy when I get tired. I:\tIt’s Friday. It’s Friday. I understand. The last thing is that we are required to ask is, to help us get in touch with you about any questions, we also like to see if you’re willing to provide information on family members and friends if we can’t get in touch with you? R:\tNo. Absolutely not. I:\tOkay. Thank you very much, [Name], for your time. I really appreciate it. R:\tYou’re welcome. I:\tI really, really do appreciate it. Thank you. R:\tYou’re welcome. As I said, I want that money donated to the San Francisco SafeHouse. I:\tYes. I have that noted. R:\tOkay. Good. Excellent. I:\tI will follow up about the letter. R:\tI appreciate it. It’d be helpful. I’m not asking for money, but I’m asking for a letter that says I was helpful that I participated in the survey. Because obviously, this helps the court diversion program, ultimately. I:\tI guess just in terms of structure, is it a “To whom this may concern: [Name] participated in this X, Y, and Z. He was helpful.” Done, and signed by the head researcher? Or is there someone more specific? R:\tDo something so you have the research ... “This information is used for,” blank, blank, blank. So they know that I participated in it, and also the purpose of it. That would be helpful. Because what’s going to happen is my attorney is going to go, “What have you done? What do we need to tell the court?” [Inaudible 58:37] number one, hopefully by the time I do this I’m sponsoring other people. I’m speaking on a regular basis at the first-time offenders program, speaking. Not participating, I’m just speaking. And then also participating in this survey. I’m continuing to work at program with recovery. I:\tI don’t foresee there being a problem with that, but if there is, is it okay if I call you back if we have any questions about that letter? R:\tYeah. Absolutely. Please do. I:\tIf you don’t hear from me, it’ll be in the mail. Yes. R:\tThanks so much. I appreciate it. Once again, the only thing is that if you block your number from me, I might not answer the call. You can easily get a Google Voice number or something. I:\tThat’s helpful. R:\tBecause I knew your name, and you don’t want people to know your name. I:\tThat’s good advice. Thank you. R:\tI’m in recovery. Some people you’re going to call are not in recovery. I:\tRight. Thank you. R:\tYou might want to tell people, going forward, that might be … It’s a suggestion. Not just for you, but for other people. Anyway. My two cents. I:\tWait, sorry. Say that last part again. You might want to what? R:\tYou might want to let them know, other people, other people who are doing this as well. Like yourself. You’re in grad school, taking psychology for grad school, right? I:\tHmm-hmm [yes]. R:\tIt’s important you guys protect yourselves. That would be my feedback. I:\tThat’s really good. I will definitely make sure that other folks are taking that advice as well. Thank you. R:\tYou’re quite welcome. You’re quite welcome. Anyway. Anything else for today? I:\tNo. I hope your presentation--your talk--at the program goes well tomorrow. R:\tThanks so much. I:\tThank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it. Have a good weekend. R:\tMy pleasure. You too. Take care. I:\tOkay. Thanks, Jeff. R:\tBye-bye. I:\tBye. [End of SF657, part two.] END OF TRANSCRIPT  SF657\t\tPage 1   \n"
